## Summary
A reference implementation demonstrating a pre-call spend gate for AI agents and a tamper-evident hash-chained audit log. The repository provides patterns for authorization checks before LLM/tool calls and cryptographically linked audit trails to ensure decisions are provably recorded.

## Key Features
- Pre-call spend gate that blocks unauthorized agent actions before execution
- Hash-chained audit log with cryptographic linking for tamper evidence
- Language- and database-agnostic patterns for adaptability
- Explicit documentation of limitations (e.g., concurrency race conditions)
- Synchronous, blocking gate checks to prevent unauthorized calls

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides essential patterns for enforcing real-time authorization and tamper-evident auditing in AI agent systems, critical for financial and policy compliance.
