## Summary
A source-agnostic signal ingestion, ranking, and scoring pipeline for crypto AI agents that fetches, validates, and ranks market signals from multiple tiers (chain-native, indexed, social) before assembling a token-budgeted JSON payload for LLM consumption. It includes a trust tier model, MAD-based anomaly detection, and a directional scoring model with equal weights.

## Key Features
- Multi-tier signal ingestion with explicit trust weighting (chain-native, indexed, social)
- MAD-based anomaly detection for robust outlier handling
- Token-budget-aware ranking and assembly for LLM consumption
- Directional scoring model with confluence-based confidence calculation
- Modular architecture with canonical SignalEvent dataclass and source-agnostic design

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a robust, trust-weighted signal pipeline for crypto AI agents, ensuring reliable directional scoring while mitigating manipulation risks through tiered trust models and anomaly detection.
