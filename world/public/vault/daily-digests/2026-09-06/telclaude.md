## Summary
telclaude is a secure, isolation-first bridge between Telegram and AI agents (Claude Code, Codex) that enforces tiered permissions, LLM pre-screening, and human approvals. It ensures secure credential handling, runtime isolation, and audit logging for operator workflows.

## Key Features
- Mandatory isolation boundary with Docker firewall enforcement for all LLM/persona execution
- Tiered permission system (READ_ONLY, WRITE_LOCAL, SOCIAL, FULL_ACCESS) with human approvals for high-risk actions
- Credential vault with sidecar daemon for secure API key injection and redaction
- Relay-authoritative memory with semantic, episodic, and compiled working-set caches
- Hard defaults including secret redaction, rate limits, audit logs, and fail-closed chat allowlists

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a critical security layer for RAG/AI stacks by enforcing strict isolation, permission tiers, and credential management in agent workflows.
