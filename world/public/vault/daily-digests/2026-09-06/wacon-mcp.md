## Summary
Wacon is a WhatsApp integration tool that connects AI agents (like Claude Code) to WhatsApp via an MCP server, enabling agents to read, send, and respond to messages while mimicking the user's communication style. It includes a CLI for direct WhatsApp interaction and a daemon-based architecture for real-time message handling.

## Key Features
- Memory-aware messaging: Agents adapt to the user's communication style per contact using layered memory (stats, qualitative notes, and persona.md).
- Real-time WhatsApp interaction via daemon: Single socket for all clients (CLI, agents, HTTP) with rate-limiting and anti-ban measures.
- Hybrid RAG for context retrieval: Combines keyword search, semantic similarity, and recency with episodic memory segmentation for efficient recall.
- Proactive agent workflows: Supports scheduled events, agenda integration, and long-polling triggers for timely responses.
- Terminal-based WhatsApp clients: Lightweight CLI and full-screen TUI for direct interaction without a browser.

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Wacon bridges AI agents and WhatsApp, enabling secure, style-aware automation of messaging workflows while preserving user privacy and reducing token waste through intelligent polling and context retrieval.
