## Summary
Mantrin is a personal chief-of-staff AI assistant that remembers and acts on user commitments, plans, and people across conversations. It combines local and rented AI components to provide an always-on, voice-first experience with durable memory and cross-session context.

## Key Features
- Durable memory with provenance tracking using SQLite for facts, commitments, and plans
- Hybrid local and rented AI components (STT, TTS, LLM) with interchangeable providers
- Always-on daemon with cross-session context and wake-word or push-to-talk input modes
- Modular architecture supporting MCP integrations (WhatsApp, Slack, X, etc.)
- Barge-in support, echo cancellation, and sub-2s voice turn processing

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Mantrin demonstrates how to build a production-grade, always-on AI agent with durable memory and modular AI components, offering a blueprint for scalable personal assistants in RAG systems.
