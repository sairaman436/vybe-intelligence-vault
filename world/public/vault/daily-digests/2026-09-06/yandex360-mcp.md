## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI assistants with tools to interact with Yandex 360 services, primarily Yandex Wiki, via OAuth tokens. It enables read/write operations, full-text search, and page management with modular service support and zero-friction installation.

## Key Features
- Modular service support (Wiki, Directory, Disk) with conditional tool registration based on environment variables
- Zero-friction installation via `uvx` with stdio transport, no local cloning required
- Secure token management using environment variables (no secrets in code/config)
- Context-optimized tool exposure—only active modules/tools are registered for AI assistants
- Full Yandex Wiki functionality: read/edit pages, search, page tree navigation, and CRUD operations

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI assistants to directly interact with Yandex 360 services like Wiki, reducing manual workflows and enhancing automation for users of Yandex 360 ecosystems.
