## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server providing real-time access to Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) data, including highway conditions, ferry schedules, vessel locations, toll rates, border wait times, and alerts via STDIO or Streamable HTTP transport.

## Key Features
- 12 specialized tools for querying WSDOT traffic and ferry data (highway conditions, ferry schedules, vessel locations, toll rates, border waits, alerts)
- Supports both STDIO and Streamable HTTP transports for MCP clients
- Built on @cyanheads/mcp-ts-core framework with declarative tool definitions, unified error handling, and pluggable auth/storage backends
- Normalized response shapes across WSDOT Traffic API and WSF Ferry API with agent-friendly output (e.g., `DriveUpSpaceCount: 0` for actionable signals)
- Configurable via environment variables with validation via Zod schemas, Docker support, and public hosted server option

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
This MCP server provides critical real-time transportation data for AI agents needing to plan routes, check ferry availability, or monitor traffic conditions in Washington State.
