## Summary
VelesDB is a local-first, embeddable database that unifies vector search, graph relationships, and columnar storage under a single query language (VelesQL). It provides an explainable agent memory system with deterministic context compression, enabling agents to recall and justify facts without relying on external APIs or cloud services.

## Key Features
- Single binary (~10 MB) combining vector, graph, and columnar storage with a unified query language (VelesQL)
- Agent memory with evidence-based recall (`why()`) that survives process restarts and shares no vocabulary with queries
- Deterministic context compiler that reduces token usage by 21.9% without LLM intervention, with auditable compression decisions
- Local-first architecture with no cloud dependencies, ensuring data sovereignty and offline operation
- Multi-language support (Python, Rust, TypeScript, Node.js) with MCP, REST, and WASM integrations

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
VelesDB is essential for RAG/AI stack builders because it eliminates the need for multiple databases, provides explainable agent memory with evidence trails, and reduces token costs through deterministic compression while maintaining local-first sovereignty.
