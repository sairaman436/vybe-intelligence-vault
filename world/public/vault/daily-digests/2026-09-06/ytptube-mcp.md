## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides a secure, read-only interface for AI assistants to inspect and optionally manage a self-hosted ytptube instance via HTTP API. It enables focused access to downloads, history, tasks, presets, and logs without exposing credentials or requiring direct API access.

## Key Features
- Safe-by-default read-only access with optional mutation control via environment variables
- Comprehensive inspection tools for downloads, history, tasks, presets, and logs
- Validated input handling to prevent unsafe yt-dlp CLI strings or raw URLs
- Credential-aware authentication with optional HTTP Basic or API key support
- Small deployment surface with stdio transport and minimal dependencies

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a secure, AI-friendly interface to manage and inspect media downloads via ytptube, reducing credential exposure and enabling controlled automation for RAG pipelines.
