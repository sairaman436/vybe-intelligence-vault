## Summary
URI Agent is a protocol-oriented terminal coding agent that enables dynamic tool loading via URI protocols, allowing models to interact with tools on-demand while keeping context minimal until needed. It supports extensible plugins, built-in MCP bridge, ACP editor integration, and broad model provider coverage.

## Key Features
- Protocol-based tool loading with progressive context to minimize model input size
- Built-in MCP bridge for managing stdio and Streamable HTTP servers as on-demand protocols
- ACP v1 editor integration for durable project-scoped sessions with model configuration
- Extensible WASM plugins for adding custom protocols and typed tools at runtime
- Broad model provider coverage via pi.dev catalog and provider-specific integrations

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
URI Agent simplifies dynamic tool integration for AI agents by enabling on-demand protocol-based tool loading, reducing context overhead and enhancing extensibility for RAG builders.
