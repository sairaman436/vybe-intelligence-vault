## Summary
serial-mcp is an MCP-compliant server that enables coding agents to interact with serial ports, UART, or USB-serial devices like microcontrollers and embedded boards. It provides non-blocking reads, protocol parsing, auto-reconnect, and resource management for seamless integration with AI agents.

## Key Features
- MCP 2025-11-25 compliant with resource change notifications and transport support (stdio/HTTP)
- Non-blocking reads with timeouts, pattern matching, and background RX streaming
- Protocol presets (AT, JSON, SLIP, COBS, NMEA-0183, Modbus ASCII) with checksum validation
- Auto-reconnect, event logging, and full line control (DTR/RTS, BREAK, flow control)
- Ring buffer for absolute stream offsets, cursor-based history replay, and data loss observability

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to directly interact with embedded hardware via serial ports, unlocking automation for firmware debugging, device control, and real-time data streaming in RAG pipelines.
