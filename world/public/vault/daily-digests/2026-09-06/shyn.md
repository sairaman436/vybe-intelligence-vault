## Summary
Shyn is a local-first memory companion for macOS (Apple Silicon) that captures, indexes, and provides instant recall of your screen content, meetings, browsing history, and notes via an encrypted on-device database. It enables AI assistants to query your personal history with total recall while ensuring privacy and zero cloud dependency.

## Key Features
- Hybrid search (keyword + semantic) over encrypted local SQLite index for millisecond recall
- Ambient screen capture and meeting transcription with on-device Whisper, purging audio immediately after transcription
- MCP-compatible JSON-RPC server for seamless integration with AI assistants like Claude
- Consent-first capture with granular controls (pause, exclude apps, delete with byte-level honesty)
- Zero cloud dependency; all data encrypted at rest in macOS Keychain

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Shyn provides a critical privacy-preserving memory layer for RAG systems, enabling AI assistants to ground responses in a user's personal history without exposing data to the cloud.
