## Summary
TradeAgent is a desktop AI agent that safely connects an AI assistant to an ATAS trading account, enabling order placement and account management without requiring terminal access or broker credentials. It enforces strict safety rules, idempotency, and reconciliation while providing a user-friendly interface for non-technical traders.

## Key Features
- Enforces idempotency and reconciliation to prevent duplicate orders or unknown account states
- Provides a user-friendly desktop interface with emergency stop functionality
- Isolates broker credentials from the AI agent, delegating authentication to ATAS
- Supports both simulated and real trading with strict safety controls
- Cross-platform core with Windows-specific installer and UI

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
TradeAgent provides a critical safety layer for AI-driven trading by enforcing idempotency, reconciliation, and strict user oversight, making it essential for RAG builders integrating with trading systems.
