## Summary
A public, read-only Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for turva.dev that exposes agent-readiness audits, security scans, and service catalogs as structured JSON. It enables AI agents to query public data without scraping HTML.

## Key Features
- Exposes turva.dev's agent-readiness scores and security scan results via MCP protocol
- Static TypeScript objects ensure deterministic, verifiable responses with embedded verification links
- Implements MCP protocol revision 2026-07-28 with Streamable HTTP transport
- No authentication required; all data is public and read-only
- Rate-limited to 100 requests per 60 seconds per IP with fail-open behavior

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a standardized, auditable way for AI agents to access public security and readiness data, simplifying integration and verification for RAG systems.
