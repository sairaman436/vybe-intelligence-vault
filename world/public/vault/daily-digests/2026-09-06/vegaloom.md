## Summary
Vega is a local-first AI coding and validation orchestration framework that enforces deterministic verification, role segregation, and fail-closed behavior for AI-assisted development workflows. It ensures code changes are validated against project-specific tests and static checks before approval, isolating worker and reviewer sessions to prevent context inheritance.

## Key Features
- Dual-role session isolation (worker/reviewer) to prevent context inheritance
- Deterministic gating using project-native verification commands (e.g., pytest, eslint)
- Fail-closed state preservation on validation failures or evidence conflicts
- Workspace baseline snapshotting to avoid misattribution of prior changes
- Configurable risk assessment and human review gates for high-impact changes

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Vega ensures AI-generated code changes are rigorously validated and auditable, reducing hallucinations and unsafe automation in RAG pipelines by enforcing project-specific verification and role-based isolation.
