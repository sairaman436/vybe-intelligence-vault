## Summary
Waggle-mcp is a local-first memory engine for AI agents that persists decisions, reasoning, and contradictions across sessions using a graph-backed storage system. It integrates with MCP-compatible clients to provide persistent, structured memory without relying on external APIs.

## Key Features
- Persistent graph memory storing decisions, reasons, and contradictions across sessions
- Hybrid retrieval combining graph, vector, and BM25 search for high-fidelity context assembly
- Local-first architecture with optional Neo4j backend for scalability
- MCP-compatible server with automatic setup and client integration (VS Code, Claude, Cursor, etc.)
- Recursive context assembly for compact, token-budgeted context packs with temporal resolution

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Waggle-mcp enables AI agents to retain long-term memory and reasoning chains across sessions, eliminating the need to repaste context and improving consistency in decision-making and task continuity.
