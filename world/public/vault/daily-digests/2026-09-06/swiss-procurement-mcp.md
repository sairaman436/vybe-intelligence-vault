## Summary
MCP server providing read-only access to the Swiss public procurement API (simap.ch), enabling AI agents to query tenders, awards, and construction codes across all cantons and the Confederation with detailed metadata and filtering capabilities.

## Key Features
- Read-only access to Swiss public procurement data via simap.ch API without authentication
- Comprehensive toolset for searching tenders, awards, and construction codes with detailed metadata
- Supports canton-specific, CPV, and BKP code filtering with explicit semantics for geographic matching
- Short-lived cache (30 min TTL) for intraday updates and live API fallback with degradation handling
- Multi-transport support (stdio, SSE, streamable-http) with containerized deployment and strict security policies

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
This server enables AI agents to programmatically access and integrate Swiss public procurement data, which is critical for applications requiring real-time tender information, construction planning, and vendor research.
