## Summary
Token Optimizer MCP is an intelligent Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to reduce context window usage by 60-90% through caching, compression, and smart tool replacements for AI development workflows like Claude Code and Desktop.

## Key Features
- 65+ specialized tools for file operations, API caching, and database queries with 60-90% token reduction
- Persistent SQLite-based caching with multi-tier (L1/L2/L3) and 6 eviction strategies
- Brotli compression achieving 2-4x typical reduction (up to 82x for repetitive content)
- Automatic tool replacement for standard operations (Read, Grep, Glob, etc.) via global hooks
- Granular token analytics with per-hook, per-action, and per-MCP-server tracking

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It maximizes context window efficiency for RAG pipelines by drastically reducing token usage through intelligent caching and compression, enabling longer context retention and lower operational costs.
