## Summary
Shadow-DB is a live-delta engine that transforms static web pages into a continuous stream of semantic events for AI agents, avoiding full-page re-extraction. It detects meaningful changes (e.g., price, availability) and emits typed, high-signal events with minimal payload size.

## Key Features
- Detects meaningful changes with 0 false positives/negatives
- Emits typed semantic events (price_change, availability_change) instead of raw HTML diffs
- Reduces event payload by 97.6% compared to full-page re-extraction
- Supports modular components (fetchers, classifiers, sinks) via interfaces
- Optional integration with Qdrant for RAG pipelines

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Shadow-DB drastically reduces token consumption and storage overhead for RAG pipelines by streaming only meaningful changes instead of re-processing entire web pages.
