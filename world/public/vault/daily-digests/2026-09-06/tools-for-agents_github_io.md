## Summary
A landing page and machine-readable manifest generator for tools-for-agents, an operating system for AI agents. It provides a curated, auto-generated set of 67 MCP tools in standardized formats for seamless agent discovery and integration.

## Key Features
- Auto-generates machine-readable manifests (`llms.txt`, `tools.json`, `llms-full.txt`) from live MCP servers via `tools/list` handshake
- Enforces CI/CD gate to prevent stale manifests with automated drift detection and correction
- Single, self-contained static page (`index.html`) with no build dependencies
- Validates page integrity using the tools-for-agents design system (`iris look`)
- Zero-dependency MCP-native tools with live web views for human and machine consumption

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It ensures AI agents can dynamically discover and interact with up-to-date tools without manual curation, eliminating drift and enabling scalable agent ecosystems.
