## Summary
SynaptoMind is a self-hosted persistent memory system for AI assistants that captures, links, clusters, and retrieves thoughts via HTTP API or MCP server. It enables AI agents to remember project decisions, goals, and unfinished tasks across sessions while keeping all data locally.

## Key Features
- Self-hosted persistent memory for AI assistants with local data storage
- Hybrid search combining vector (vec0), BM25 (FTS5), and entity matching
- MCP server integration for seamless AI agent integration (Claude, Cursor, OpenCode)
- Local embedding generation via HuggingFace Transformers (no API keys required)
- Auto-clustering, smart notes, frontier ranking, and context management for AI workflows

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
SynaptoMind provides a critical persistent memory layer for AI agents, enabling them to retain context, decisions, and tasks across sessions without relying on external services or manual note-taking.
