## Summary
Stela is a self-hosted platform for publishing, versioning, and sharing AI agent-generated artifacts (e.g., dashboards, prototypes) with stable URLs, revision history, and pinned visual comments. It acts as a neutral hub for artifacts from any MCP-speaking agent, enabling collaboration and feedback loops without vendor lock-in.

## Key Features
- Publish artifacts from any MCP-speaking agent (Claude Code, ChatGPT, etc.) to a stable URL with full revision history.
- Three-tier sharing model: private, everyone (signed-in users), or restricted (named individuals).
- Pinned visual comments on artifacts with version-specific feedback threads.
- Safe rendering via sandboxed iframes with strict CSP to prevent network egress or malicious code execution.
- Zero heavy dependencies: uses SQLite (or Azure Table/Blob) for storage, deployable as a single Node process.

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Stela provides a vendor-neutral, self-hosted solution for managing and collaborating on AI-generated artifacts, ensuring control over access, versioning, and feedback without relying on proprietary platforms.
