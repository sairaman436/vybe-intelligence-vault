## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes the full Zabbix API as MCP tools, enabling AI assistants like Claude, VS Code, and JetBrains to interact with Zabbix for monitoring, alerting, and infrastructure management.

## Key Features
- Complete Zabbix API coverage with 237 tools for hosts, problems, triggers, templates, and more
- Admin web portal with multi-token authentication, scopes, and IP restrictions for secure access
- Extension tools like `host_status_get`, `infrastructure_summary_get`, and `graph_render` for pre-correlated views and PDF reports
- Multi-server support with per-server tokens and read-only mode to prevent accidental changes
- Production-ready deployment with systemd, Docker, logrotate, and TLS/HTTPS support

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It bridges AI assistants with Zabbix, enabling natural language queries and automated actions for monitoring and alerting workflows.
