## Summary
A lightweight MCP (Model Context Protocol) server written in Go that provides web and academic search capabilities with zero API key requirements for basic operation. It supports multiple search engines, intelligent fallback mechanisms, and optional LLM-powered summarization for RAG pipelines.

## Key Features
- Zero API key required for basic operation (engine mode) with built-in Baidu and Bing search engines
- Intelligent API key pooling with round-robin and priority strategies for high availability
- Multi-engine parallel orchestration with URL deduplication and score-based result filtering
- Built-in caching (SQLite) with 6-hour expiration and automatic cleanup
- Optional LLM-powered summarization and PDF parsing (MinerU integration) for enhanced content extraction

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a unified, configurable interface for integrating multiple search engines into RAG pipelines with intelligent fallback and caching, reducing dependency on external APIs while maintaining high reliability.
