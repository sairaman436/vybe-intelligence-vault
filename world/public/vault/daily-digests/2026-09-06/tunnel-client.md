## Summary
The tunnel-client enables secure, private connectivity between local or on-premises MCP servers and OpenAI's hosted services (ChatGPT, Codex, Responses API, AgentKit) without exposing the MCP server to the public internet. It acts as a secure bridge, ensuring secure and compliant access to private MCP resources.

## Key Features
- Secure long-polling connection to OpenAI's control plane for MCP server access
- Embeddable Go SDK for in-memory MCP transport integration
- Operator-visible health checks (/healthz, /readyz, /metrics) and UI dashboard
- Support for Docker, Kubernetes, and VM deployments with Cloudflare Tunnel
- Role-based access control and permission management for tunnels and connectors

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables RAG/AI stack builders to securely connect private MCP servers to OpenAI's ecosystem without exposing them to the internet, ensuring compliance and reducing deployment complexity.
