## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes the Unfolded Circle Remote 3/Remote Two's configuration and capabilities as conversational tools for AI assistants like Claude. Enables natural language control, configuration, and backup of the remote's UI, buttons, activities, and devices.

## Key Features
- Conversational tool integration for AI assistants (e.g., Claude) to control and configure the remote via plain language
- Discovery and setup of Unfolded Circle remotes via mDNS or direct IP
- Read-only tools for querying remote info, activities, devices, and UI pages
- Mutating tools for remapping buttons, updating UI pages, and restoring configurations with safety checks (dry-run by default)
- Automatic backups before any configuration changes and support for restoring previous states

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI assistants to directly interact with and configure physical devices like the Unfolded Circle Remote, bridging the gap between conversational AI and real-world hardware automation.
