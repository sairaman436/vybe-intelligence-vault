## Summary
whats-loaded-mcp is an MCP server that audits and reports what is consuming an AI agent's context window before any user input is provided, including skill descriptions, memory files, and configured MCP servers. It helps identify redundant or costly resources to optimize context usage.

## Key Features
- Reports pre-session context consumption by source (skills, memory files, MCP servers)
- Identifies duplicate skills and calculates recoverable token savings
- Ranks skills by token cost to prioritize cleanup efforts
- Analyzes memory file imports without exposing sensitive content
- Provides deployment flexibility via npm or direct source installation

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It helps AI engineers and developers reclaim wasted context window space by identifying and removing redundant or costly skills and memory files before they impact model performance.
