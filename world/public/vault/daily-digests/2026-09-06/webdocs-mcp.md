## Summary
webdocs-mcp is a lightweight MCP server that crawls documentation sites, indexes them into DuckDB with hybrid (semantic + BM25) search, and exposes tools for LLM agents to retrieve current, version-specific documentation. It runs offline by default but supports OpenAI embeddings for production use.

## Key Features
- Breadth-first crawler with parent/child hierarchy tracking for documentation sites
- Hybrid search combining embeddings (hashing or OpenAI) and BM25 for robust retrieval
- Exposes tools (search_docs, list_doc_pages, get_doc_page) over MCP for LLM agents
- Portable DuckDB-based index with zero operational overhead
- Fully offline-testable with injectable fetcher and in-memory fake sites

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables LLM agents to retrieve current, version-specific documentation directly from source, eliminating hallucinations caused by stale or outdated training data.
