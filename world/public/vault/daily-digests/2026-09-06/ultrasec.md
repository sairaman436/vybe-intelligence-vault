## Summary
ultrasec is a cross-file security audit tool that traces untrusted data across functions and files, orchestrates OSS scanners, and adversarially verifies findings into a cited, tiered report. It combines deterministic taint analysis with AI-driven reasoning to identify exploitable vulnerabilities and business-logic flaws.

## Key Features
- Cross-file taint analysis to trace untrusted data across functions and files
- Integration with 18+ OSS scanners (e.g., Trivy, Semgrep, Grype) for normalized, de-duplicated findings
- Adversarial AI verification to validate and rank findings by risk (EPSS, CISA KEV, CVSS)
- Config, auth, and cloud/IaC detectors for non-taint vulnerabilities (e.g., CORS, cookie flags, security headers)
- Modular pipeline with tools for mapping, scanning, triage, investigation, verification, and reporting

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a precise, cross-file security audit with adversarial AI verification, bridging the gap between deterministic engines and pure-LLM scanners for RAG/AI stack builders.
