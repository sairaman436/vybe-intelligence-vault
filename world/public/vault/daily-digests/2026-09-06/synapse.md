## Summary
A Rust-based MCP and CLI server for local Synapse workflows, providing full-parity functionality to the original TypeScript implementation. It enables Docker, Compose, host inspection, SSH, ZFS, and file operations through standardized MCP tools and CLI commands.

## Key Features
- Exposes two MCP tools (`flux` and `scout`) covering 59 production actions for Docker, Compose, host, SSH, ZFS, and file operations
- Provides CLI parity with MCP tools for scriptable operator workflows
- Implements strict safety and trust models with read/write scopes and confirmation gates for destructive operations
- Supports multiple runtime surfaces: MCP, CLI, REST (compatibility), and a lightweight static web admin shell
- Offers robust authentication via bearer tokens or Google OAuth, with loopback stdio support for local development

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a secure, standardized interface for AI agents to interact with local infrastructure, enabling reliable automation of Docker, Compose, and host operations within RAG pipelines.
