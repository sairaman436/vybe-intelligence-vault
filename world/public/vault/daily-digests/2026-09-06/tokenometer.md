## Summary
Tokenometer is a multi-provider LLM cost calculator, token counter, and latency benchmarking tool that supports Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, Mistral, and Cohere. It provides empirical token counting, USD cost estimation, format comparison, and CI guardrails via CLI, GitHub Action, VS Code extension, and Claude Code skill.

## Key Features
- Multi-provider support (Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, Mistral, Cohere) with 63 models
- Empirical token counting via provider APIs (e.g., Anthropic's `messages.countTokens`)
- USD cost estimation and format comparison (JSON, YAML, XML, Markdown, text)
- Latency benchmarking (TTFT + tokens/sec, p50/p95/mean) and vision-token cost calculation
- CI-native integration via GitHub Action with PR cost-diff guardrails and SARIF output

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Tokenometer provides essential cost and latency insights for RAG builders to optimize LLM usage, enforce budget constraints in CI, and compare provider/model performance across formats.
