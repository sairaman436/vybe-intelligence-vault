## Summary
An MCP server (Streamable HTTP) that wraps the Broad Institute's SpliceAI Lookup backends to provide LLM-ergonomic tools for splice-impact prediction, including SpliceAI, Pangolin, and SpliceAI-10k models, along with an Ensembl-VEP-backed variant resolver.

## Key Features
- Provides LLM-ergonomic tools for splice-impact prediction via SpliceAI, Pangolin, and SpliceAI-10k models
- Includes an Ensembl-VEP-backed variant resolver for canonical variant IDs (CHROM-POS-REF-ALT)
- Implements caching, rate limiting, and concurrency control to handle upstream fragility and cold starts
- Supports batch processing for gene panels and progress notifications via MCP background tasks
- Offers server discovery tools, rate budgeting, and typed error handling for robust agent integration

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
This tool bridges the gap between the Broad Institute's SpliceAI Lookup service and AI agents by providing a standardized, LLM-friendly API for splice-impact predictions and variant resolution.
