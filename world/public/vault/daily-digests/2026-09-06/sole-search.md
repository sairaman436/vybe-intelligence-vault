## Summary
sole-search is an AI skill designed to help small business owners in Korea find government and local subsidies tailored to their business profile (industry, location, years in operation, employees, revenue). It crawls official sources like 소상공인24 and 기업마당, performs eligibility checks, and generates reports highlighting applicable subsidies, loans, and grants with clear deadlines and requirements.

## Key Features
- Automated crawling of official Korean small business subsidy databases (소상공인24, 기업마당) with full coverage reporting
- Profile-based 5-tier eligibility assessment (confirmed, conditional, needs verification, ineligible, business transition candidate)
- Incremental reporting (diff mode) to track new, updated, or expired subsidies since last check
- Transparent handling of unreadable attachments (e.g., HWP files) with clear 'verification needed' flags
- Generates structured reports with 'today's applicable subsidies,' coverage manifests, and loan details

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It streamlines the discovery and eligibility verification of Korean government subsidies for small businesses, reducing manual research time and improving access to critical financial support.
