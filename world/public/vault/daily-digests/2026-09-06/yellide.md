## Summary
Yellide is a local, privacy-focused media indexing tool that searches photos, videos, and audio files by their content rather than filenames. It operates as an MCP server, enabling natural language queries via tools like Claude without making network calls or modifying files.

## Key Features
- Indexes media files by content (not filenames) using SHA-256 hashing for identity
- Runs entirely on-device as an MCP server with no network calls or external dependencies
- Supports natural language queries via tools like Claude for intuitive search
- Detects cloud placeholders and avoids unnecessary downloads using POSIX block checks
- Propagates metadata and captions across related files (e.g., shoots) to optimize indexing

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Yellide enables RAG builders to integrate robust, privacy-preserving media indexing into AI workflows without relying on cloud services or exposing sensitive data.
