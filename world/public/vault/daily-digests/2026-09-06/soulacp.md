## Summary
SoulACP is a Python client library for the Agent Client Protocol (ACP) that enables seamless interaction with various AI agent CLIs through a unified interface. It provides managed session handling, connection pooling, and async streaming for real-time agent communication.

## Key Features
- Native CLI session integration with 30+ supported agents (e.g., Claude, Gemini, Codex)
- ManagedSession API for safe session reuse, explicit reset, and retry with exponential backoff
- Bounded connection pooling with FIFO backpressure and lifecycle retirement
- Async streaming for real-time response chunks and structured session context
- Pure stdlib core with optional OpenTelemetry telemetry support

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
SoulACP simplifies the integration of multiple AI agent CLIs into RAG pipelines by providing a unified, session-managed interface with robust error handling and async capabilities.
