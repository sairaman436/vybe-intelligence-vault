## Summary
willow-mcp is an agent-neutral MCP server providing persistent memory, task execution, and multi-backend storage for AI agents. It integrates SQLite, Postgres, and a task queue (Kart) with manifest-based ACL authorization, enabling seamless collaboration across agents like Claude Code and Cursor.

## Key Features
- Three storage backends (SOIL SQLite, Postgres knowledge base, Kart task queue) with full-text search and soft-delete support
- Manifest-based filesystem ACL for authorization without external auth services
- Sandboxed bootstrap for local and fleet deployments with automatic schema validation
- Comprehensive toolset for knowledge ingestion, gap management, and task routing
- Integration with external systems via Grove channels, FRANK ledger, and NEST/Nugget bridges

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
willow-mcp provides the foundational memory, task execution, and orchestration layer critical for building scalable, multi-agent RAG systems with persistent state and secure collaboration.
