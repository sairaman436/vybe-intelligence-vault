## Summary
A Bun CLI tool that enables AI agents to interact with the NYT Wordle game via a headless browser, providing real-time game state as JSON and candidate suggestions from a Wordle constraint solver (Hurdle).

## Key Features
- Headless browser automation using Bun.WebView for real-time Wordle gameplay without external dependencies like Puppeteer or Playwright.
- Persistent browser profile for multi-turn agent interactions, enabling stateful gameplay.
- JSON output of game state, including board, keyboard, and candidate suggestions from Hurdle.
- Built-in Hurdle constraint solver for generating optimal guesses based on current board state.
- Configurable via file, environment variables, or CLI flags for flexibility in deployment.

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a standardized way for AI agents to interact with and solve Wordle puzzles, offering real-time game state and constraint-based suggestions for RAG systems.
