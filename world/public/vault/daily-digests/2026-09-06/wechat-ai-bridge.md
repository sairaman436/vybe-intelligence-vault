## Summary
A self-hosted bridge that enables running local AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex) directly from WeChat private chats via WeChat's iLink bot endpoints. It supports session management, tool approval, bidirectional file relay, and multi-backend AI agent integration.

## Key Features
- Enables running local AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex) from WeChat chats with session persistence
- Supports interactive tool approval for Claude Code agents and bidirectional file relay (inbound/outbound)
- Multi-backend support (Claude, Codex, experimental Gemini) with dynamic switching via WeChat commands
- Rate limiting, idle monitoring, message batching, and robust file path sanitization for security
- SQLite-based session persistence and cross-platform deployment with strict file permission enforcement

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It bridges WeChat's private chat interface with local AI coding agents, enabling secure and interactive agent workflows directly from a widely used messaging platform.
