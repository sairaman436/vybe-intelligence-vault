## Summary
VietLex is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system specialized for Vietnamese legal document retrieval and query answering. It leverages hybrid retrieval (dense + sparse) with remote inference for embeddings and reranking, while storing vectors in Pinecone and metadata locally in SQLite.

## Key Features
- Provider-free gold adjudication with immutable human-review artifacts
- Hybrid retrieval combining dense (Pinecone) and sparse (SQLite FTS5) indexing
- Dual-reranker system with Qdrant ColBERT and Pinecone BGE fallback
- Automated fallback mechanisms for embedding and reranking provider failures
- Semantic caching and query rewriting for optimized legal document retrieval

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
VietLex demonstrates a robust, production-grade RAG pipeline for non-English legal documents with critical hybrid retrieval, remote inference, and fallback strategies essential for building scalable AI systems.
