## Summary
Thorondor is a self-hosted, data-sovereign semantic web-search service designed for AI agents. It replaces hosted search-for-agents APIs with an on-premises pipeline that discovers URLs via SearXNG, crawls pages with Crawl4AI, chunks content using a semantic chunker, reranks passages, and returns cited evidence through REST and MCP interfaces.

## Key Features
- Multi-engine URL discovery via SearXNG with domain filtering and safety checks
- Concurrent, JavaScript-capable page crawling with Crawl4AI and trafilatura cleaning
- Semantic chunking with ClusterSemanticChunker and BGE-M3 embeddings for optimal boundaries
- Batched reranking with BGE-reranker-v2-m3 to score passages against the original query
- Dual REST and MCP interfaces for seamless integration with AI agents and applications

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Thorondor provides a critical, self-hosted alternative to proprietary web search APIs, enabling RAG builders to maintain data sovereignty while integrating high-quality, cited search results directly into their pipelines.
