## Summary
socxen is an agentic SOC analyst skill for Claude Code that automates the investigation and triage of Exabeam New-Scale alerts and cases. It integrates with Exabeam's MCP, applies safety guardrails, and provides end-to-end evidence gathering and decision-making while enforcing human-in-the-loop controls.

## Key Features
- End-to-end investigation of Exabeam alerts/cases with real-time data access
- Safety-first design with dual governance gates (Claude Code permissions + skill confirmation)
- Built-in untrusted-telemetry guardrails to prevent malicious content execution
- High-performance audit logging (~16 µs/event) for compliance and debugging
- One-command install with bundled Exabeam MCP and auto-registration

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a critical safety-first agentic framework for automating SOC operations while ensuring human oversight and compliance, making it essential for AI-driven security workflows.
