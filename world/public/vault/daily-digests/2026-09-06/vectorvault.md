## Summary
VectorVault is a high-performance, from-scratch vector search engine implemented in C++20. It features HNSW algorithm, AVX2 SIMD acceleration, and memory-mapped persistence, delivering sub-millisecond query latency for 100k vectors without relying on external libraries like FAISS.

## Key Features
- Pure C++20 implementation with no external dependencies for core algorithms
- AVX2 SIMD-accelerated distance computation for 8x performance boost
- Memory-mapped persistence with CRC32 checksums for zero-copy, deterministic I/O
- Sub-millisecond query latency (P50 < 0.21ms) with 97% recall at 100k vectors
- REST API and Python client for seamless integration with AI/ML pipelines

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
VectorVault provides a high-performance, dependency-free alternative for vector search in RAG systems, enabling sub-millisecond latency and deterministic results without the overhead of external libraries.
