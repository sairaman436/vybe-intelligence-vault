## Summary
VaultRun provides a self-hosted, secure runtime for executing AI agent commands in isolated Docker sandboxes on your own infrastructure. It enables safe code execution, database queries, cloud API calls, and file management without external SaaS dependencies or data leaving your network.

## Key Features
- Isolated Docker container execution per session with strict resource limits (CPU, memory, timeout)
- 53-tool MCP server supporting both stdio and HTTP transport for integration with Claude, OpenAI, and custom agents
- HMAC-signed audit trail for all actions with path traversal prevention and non-root container execution
- Enterprise-grade SSO (OIDC + SAML 2.0) for dashboard authentication, available separately
- GitHub CI runner for executing PR test suites in isolated sandboxes with Slack/Teams notifications

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
VaultRun is essential for AI stack builders who need a secure, self-hosted environment to safely execute agent commands without relying on external SaaS platforms or exposing sensitive data.
