## Summary
A production-ready Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes weather data, tools, resources, and prompts to any MCP-compatible client (e.g., Claude Desktop) via the OpenWeatherMap API. Built with Python, FastMCP, and Pydantic for structured, typed interactions.

## Key Features
- Exposes weather tools, resources, and prompts via MCP for AI assistants
- Structured, typed interactions using Pydantic models for inputs/outputs
- Full test suite with mocked HTTP calls for offline testing
- Clean architecture with separation of concerns (business logic vs. MCP glue)
- Production hygiene with environment-based config, logging, and error handling

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a standardized way for AI assistants to access weather data through MCP, reducing integration complexity and enabling reusable, typed interactions for RAG pipelines.
