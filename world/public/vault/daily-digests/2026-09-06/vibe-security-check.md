## Summary
A security audit toolkit for AI-built applications that identifies vulnerabilities in both the application code and the AI pipeline used to generate it. It provides offline, account-free checks for common security flaws introduced by AI-generated code.

## Key Features
- Two specialized skills for different security perspectives: `vibe-security-check` (data exposure) and `vibe-lint` (maintainability)
- Four executable scripts that produce evidence-based findings (e.g., `anon-key-probe.sh`, `bundle-secrets.sh`)
- Thirteen Semgrep rules tailored for AI-generated code vulnerabilities (e.g., hardcoded secrets, mass assignment, taint analysis)
- Tool-aware routing to map generator-specific vulnerabilities (e.g., builders, editors, agents)
- Methodology enforcing executable proof and trust boundary analysis for findings

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It proactively identifies critical security flaws in AI-generated applications before deployment, reducing the risk of data breaches and maintenance issues.
