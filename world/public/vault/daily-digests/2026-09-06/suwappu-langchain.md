## Summary
A production-oriented LangChain 1.x adapter for building AI agents and paid workflows on Suwappu, a cross-chain DEX API. It provides structured tools for asset discovery, pricing, simulation, and transaction preparation with explicit authority separation between research and execution phases.

## Key Features
- Nine default tools covering the swap lifecycle (quote, simulate, prepare, portfolio, prices, chains, tokens, status, history) with structured Zod input schemas
- Explicit authority separation: research/preparation tools (unsigned transactions) vs. managed execution (opt-in with approval callbacks)
- Idempotency and reconciliation primitives built into the execution contract for durability
- Cross-chain quote support with optional wallet binding and slippage control
- Production-grade runtime controls (timeouts, error handling, telemetry, custom fetch integration)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI engineers to build secure, production-ready DeFi agents with structured tooling and explicit authority boundaries for cross-chain transactions.
