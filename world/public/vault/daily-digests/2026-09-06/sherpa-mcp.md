## Summary
A Claude Code plugin that offloads code-related tasks such as reading, searching, and batch-editing to a local LLM, reducing token usage in Claude's context while leveraging local processing power for heavy lifting.

## Key Features
- Delegates code exploration and transformation tasks to a local LLM, reducing token load in Claude's context by up to 99%
- Provides five MCP tools: health_check, delegate_exploration, delegate_search, delegate_transform, and apply_transform
- Supports automatic and explicit invocation with configurable backend settings (Ollama, llama.cpp, LM Studio)
- Includes path confinement and security checks to prevent unauthorized file access or execution
- Offers project-level and user-level configuration via JSON files or environment variables

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables RAG and AI stack builders to offload resource-intensive code analysis and editing tasks to local models, significantly reducing token usage and context overhead in AI assistants.
