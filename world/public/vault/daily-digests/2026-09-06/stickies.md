## Summary
Stickies is a persistent sticky note system for Claude Code that allows users to pin important notes, todos, or decisions which survive session resets and terminal closures. It integrates with local SQLite storage and supports auto-capture, git sync, and a Kanban-style Flow Board for project planning.

## Key Features
- Zero-turn capture of notes via `!!sticky` directives in Claude Code replies, persisting without extra tool calls or tokens.
- Auto-capture and session-start digest with importance-graded injection (P1/P2/P3) for efficient note retrieval.
- Git-backed sync (opt-in) for cross-machine note consistency and conflict-free merging.
- Flow Board Kanban for visualizing project progress derived from `.planning/ROADMAP.md` or `.flow/` snapshots.
- Multi-surface support including terminal, desktop, mobile, and Discord via MCP and CLI tools.

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Stickies provides a lightweight, local-first alternative to AI memory systems for developers, enabling persistent, user-controlled note capture and project tracking without cloud dependency or LLM overhead.
