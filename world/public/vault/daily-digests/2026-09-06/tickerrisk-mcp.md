## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates real-time event data (earnings, FDA, legal, SEC, clinical) to assess option trade risk for stocks, enabling AI assistants to evaluate catalyst exposure within expiry windows.

## Key Features
- Horizon-dependent catalyst risk scoring (0-100) for stocks within expiry windows
- Integration with AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor) via MCP
- Multi-source event data (earnings, FDA, legal, SEC, clinical trials)
- Wheel trading strategy scanners (cash-secured puts, covered calls)
- Comparative analysis tool for up to 25 tickers

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI assistants to evaluate hidden event risks in option trades, reducing blind spots in premium selling strategies.
