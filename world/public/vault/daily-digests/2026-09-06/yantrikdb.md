## Summary
YantrikDB is an embedded cognitive memory engine designed for persistent AI systems, enabling hierarchical, contextual, and time-aware memory management with built-in decay, contradiction detection, and autonomous consolidation. It operates as a local-first, embedded database with optional cluster support for multi-node deployments.

## Key Features
- Embedded, local-first architecture with no server process required, ensuring offline functionality and minimal latency
- Hierarchical memory system with semantic, episodic, and procedural memory types, supporting contextual recall and consolidation
- Built-in temporal decay and contradiction detection for adaptive, human-like memory behavior
- Knowledge graph integration for entity relationships and bridge detection, improving recall precision
- Decoupled write path with LSM-based vector index for high write throughput and lock-free reads

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
YantrikDB provides a purpose-built memory architecture for RAG systems, eliminating the inefficiencies of context stuffing while enabling persistent, adaptive, and hierarchical memory that scales without token bloat.
