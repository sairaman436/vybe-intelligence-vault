## Summary
UIZZE MCP provides an anti-slop UI context layer for coding agents, enabling them to inspect real UI references before implementation. It offers a hosted MCP workflow with design contracts, validation, audits, and critiques to improve UI development accuracy and reduce generic guesses.

## Key Features
- Public catalog of real web and iOS UI references for visual context
- Structured design contracts and implementation manifests for agents
- Hosted MCP workflow with validation, audits, and critiques
- Bearer token-based authentication for secure agent access
- Integration with popular coding agents like Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables coding agents to avoid generic UI implementations by providing real-world visual context and structured validation workflows.
