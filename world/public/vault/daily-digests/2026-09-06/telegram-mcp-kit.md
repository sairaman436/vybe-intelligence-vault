## Summary
A production-ready kit to connect MCP clients like Claude Code to a user's Telegram account via MTProto, enabling secure chat reading and message sending. It includes patches, a shared daemon, and a self-installing prompt for rapid setup (~15 minutes).

## Key Features
- Shared daemon for efficient multi-session Telegram access (reduces RAM usage by ~2.7GB per session)
- Production-tested patches for upstream `telegram-mcp` (SSE transport, extra tools, multi-account support)
- Self-installing prompt (`PROMPT.md`) for rapid setup (~15 minutes) with minimal manual steps
- Comprehensive documentation (GOTCHAS.md, SECURITY.md) addressing common pitfalls and security considerations
- Windows launcher + watchdog for automated daemon management and crash recovery

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to securely interact with Telegram accounts in production environments, bridging a critical gap for RAG systems requiring real-time chat and media access.
