## Summary
An MCP server providing high-fidelity web search and retrieval tools for AI agents, supporting Exa, Tavily, and Firecrawl providers with tiered fallback strategies, explicit provenance tracking, and SSRF guards for reliable source-grounded research.

## Key Features
- Six read-only tools for web search, page fetching, and research discovery with explicit provenance
- Tiered retrieval cascade (Exa → Camoufox → Tavily → Firecrawl) with SSRF guards
- Support for AI/ML paper discovery and developer-source search (GitHub issues, PRs, docs)
- Configurable freshness, domain filtering, and result shaping (full body, concise summary, or grounded answer)
- Local caching via Valkey and cross-platform credential storage options

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a portable, inspectable, and provider-agnostic retrieval layer that enhances RAG pipelines with reliable source grounding, fallback strategies, and auditability for AI agents.
