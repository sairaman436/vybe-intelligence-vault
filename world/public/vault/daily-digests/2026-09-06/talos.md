## Summary
Talos is a security-first autonomous agent framework that executes actions only after a deterministic kernel validates each request with a time-bound, single-use token. It ensures models propose actions but never decide, providing verifiable safety for shell access and tool execution.

## Key Features
- Deterministic security kernel that authorizes every action with a single-use, 30-second token bound to exact arguments
- Adversarial testing suite (164 red-team scenarios) to validate security claims
- Sandboxed shell execution (via Bubblewrap or sandbox-exec) with refusal to run unprotected
- Zero default identities and no multi-tenant support for strict security boundaries
- Audit trails and detailed logging for every action and refusal

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Talos provides a verifiable security model for autonomous agents, ensuring safe shell access and tool execution by enforcing deterministic, time-bound authorization for every action.
