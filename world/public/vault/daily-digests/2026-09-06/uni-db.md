## Summary
Uni is an embedded database combining a property graph (OpenCypher), vector search, and columnar storage (Lance) into a single engine. It enables local, fast, multimodal data access with durability via object storage (S3/GCS/local) and is designed for applications requiring embedded, serverless database capabilities.

## Key Features
- Embedded & serverless operation with no separate server process
- Property graph queries via OpenCypher with MATCH, CREATE, WHERE, and aggregations
- K-NN vector search with pre-filtering, threshold support, and hybrid fusion (vector + BM25)
- Serializable transactions with snapshot isolation and optimistic concurrency control
- Columnar storage backed by Lance with support for local disk or object storage (S3/GCS)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Uni provides a unified, embedded solution for RAG pipelines requiring both graph and vector search capabilities, eliminating the need for multiple specialized databases while ensuring local, low-latency access.
