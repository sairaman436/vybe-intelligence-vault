## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for observing Vercel projects and deployments via stdio, designed as a stateless reference implementation to demonstrate clean configuration and credential handling for deployment workflows.

## Key Features
- Read-only observation tools for Vercel projects and deployments (list/get operations)
- Stateless design with configuration re-read from environment on every tool call
- Secure credential handling with redaction guards to prevent token leakage
- Configurable request throttling and concurrency limits for Vercel API calls
- Diagnostics routed to stderr to maintain stdio protocol purity

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a secure, stateless MCP server for integrating Vercel deployment data into AI workflows without exposing credentials or requiring persistent infrastructure.
