## Summary
WorkloadTruth is a command-line tool and MCP server that classifies GPU workloads (TRAINING, INFERENCE, or IDLE) using only hardware telemetry like utilization, memory patterns, and power draw, without requiring code changes or self-reported job labels. It provides an audit trail and evasion-robustness benchmarking for AI workload governance.

## Key Features
- Classifies GPU workloads (TRAINING/INFERENCE/IDLE) from telemetry alone without code changes or self-reported labels
- Provides a hash-chained audit log for tamper-proof workload tracking
- Includes an evasion-robustness benchmark to test classifier resilience against adversarial workloads
- Offers both synthetic and real NVIDIA GPU backends for testing and production use
- Exposes an MCP server for agent-native integration and automation

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI infrastructure teams to automatically verify GPU workload types, preventing cost misallocation and unauthorized workload changes without requiring code modifications or manual declarations.
