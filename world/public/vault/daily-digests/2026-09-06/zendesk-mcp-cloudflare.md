## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server providing secure Zendesk API integration via Google OAuth, deployed on Cloudflare Workers. It enables MCP clients to interact with Zendesk data (tickets, users, macros, etc.) through authenticated remote connections.

## Key Features
- Comprehensive Zendesk API coverage for reading (tickets, users, macros, etc.) and limited writing (macros only)
- Secure Google OAuth authentication for user access control
- Serverless deployment on Cloudflare Workers with global edge distribution
- Full TypeScript implementation with Zod validation and modular architecture
- Real-time communication via Server-Sent Events (SSE) for MCP clients

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables secure, authenticated access to Zendesk data for AI agents via the MCP protocol, simplifying integration for RAG systems needing Zendesk context.
