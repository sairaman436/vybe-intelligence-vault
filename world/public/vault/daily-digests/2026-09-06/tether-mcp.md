## Summary
Tether MCP Server is a local Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI agents to securely access end-to-end encrypted Apple Health data (sleep, heart rate, menstrual cycle, weight, water, symptoms) without exposing raw data to the cloud. It acts as a bridge between the Tether iOS app and user-controlled AI agents like Claude Code or Desktop.

## Key Features
- Secure local decryption of Apple Health data using end-to-end encryption (Curve25519 ECDH + AES-GCM)
- MCP-compliant interface for seamless integration with AI agents like Claude Code/Desktop
- QR code-based pairing for secure device authorization and key exchange
- Cache-first data access with configurable TTL for low-latency queries
- Strict privacy controls with opt-in for sensitive data (menstrual cycle, symptoms, notes)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to securely and privately access sensitive health data from Apple Health without compromising user privacy or relying on cloud-based AI services.
