## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for TickTick task management that enables AI agents to interact with TickTick's unofficial v2 API for task lifecycle operations, including creation, updates, completion tracking, and filtering.

## Key Features
- Full task lifecycle management (create, update, complete, delete, move, subtask)
- Field-preserving updates to avoid API field wiping on partial updates
- Day-of-week validation for date fields to prevent off-by-one errors
- Read-after-write verification with `_verification_warnings` for data consistency
- Idempotent completion tracking to ensure tasks are reviewed exactly once

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides AI agents with a robust, field-preserving interface to manage tasks in TickTick, enabling seamless integration with personal productivity workflows and ensuring data consistency through validation and verification mechanisms.
