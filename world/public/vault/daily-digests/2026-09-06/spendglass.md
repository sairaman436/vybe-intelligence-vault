## Summary
Spendglass is a local-only financial transaction manager that syncs bank data via the Redbark open-banking API into a SQLite database, provides a password-protected web UI for analytics, and exposes a read-only MCP server for local AI agents to query spending data securely.

## Key Features
- Local-only storage and processing of bank transactions with no cloud dependency
- Password-protected web UI for spending analytics and merchant identity management
- Read-only MCP server exposing 16 tools for AI agents to query financial data
- Automated merchant identity pipeline with optional AI-powered enrichment
- Scheduled syncs, backups, and deterministic trend analysis without AI models

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a secure, local-first way for AI agents to interact with sensitive financial data without exposing it to external services, making it essential for privacy-focused RAG applications.
