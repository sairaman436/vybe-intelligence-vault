## Summary
Codex Vision Bridge is an MCP server that enables text-only LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek) to interact with images through structured vision primitives. It provides a 13-tool suite for tasks like image description, object localization, OCR, annotation, cropping, and automated anomaly scanning, powered by Xiaomi MiMo V2.5's multimodal API.

## Key Features
- 13 built-in vision tools for structured image interaction (e.g., locate_object, ocr_image, annotate_image, scan_anomalies)
- Supports text-only LLMs (Codex, DeepSeek) to perform vision tasks via MCP protocol
- Zero third-party runtime dependencies (single-file Python implementation)
- Automated anomaly scanning with multi-candidate verification and structured reporting
- Multi-image reasoning (compare_infer) and interactive graph-based workflows (reason_graph)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It bridges the gap between text-only LLMs and multimodal capabilities, enabling RAG systems to process, analyze, and annotate images with structured outputs for richer AI interactions.
