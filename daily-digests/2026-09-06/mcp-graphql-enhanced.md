## Summary
An enhanced Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for GraphQL that bridges LLMs with complex GraphQL APIs, enabling surgical introspection, dynamic headers, and federated query capabilities while avoiding standard introspection limits.

## Key Features
- Surgical GraphQL introspection via typeNames and typeDepth parameters to minimize LLM context noise
- Dual transport support (STDIO and HTTP/JSON-RPC) for MCP clients and external systems
- Dynamic headers and robust variables parsing for secure and flexible API interactions
- Federated multi-node architecture for aggregating and deduplicating results across multiple GraphQL endpoints
- Built-in GraphiQL IDE and observability tools for debugging and schema exploration

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables LLMs to interact predictably and efficiently with large-scale GraphQL APIs by providing granular control over introspection and query execution, overcoming common architectural limits.
