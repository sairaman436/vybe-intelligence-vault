## Summary
docent is an experimental MCP server written in Rust that provides semantic and BM25 document search capabilities. It indexes markdown files in-memory, enabling agents to query document content with hybrid search methods while preserving document structure.

## Key Features
- Hybrid semantic + BM25 search for markdown documents
- In-memory indexing with auto-refresh on file changes
- Section-aware chunking preserving heading structure
- Streamable HTTP-based MCP server interface
- Configurable embedding models via FastEmbed

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a lightweight, in-memory hybrid search solution for markdown documents, enabling agents to efficiently query and retrieve contextually relevant information for RAG pipelines.
