## Summary
MicroVM sandboxes for AI agents, built on the cocoon stack to enable fast, secure, and isolated execution environments. It provides sub-millisecond warm claims, tens-of-milliseconds pool misses, and ~200ms cold boots on bare metal.

## Key Features
- Sub-millisecond warm claims with pool-based management
- Tens-of-milliseconds golden snapshot cloning for pool misses
- ~200ms cold boot on bare metal
- Two network lanes: `net=none` (Firecracker, vsock-only) and `net=egress` (Cloud Hypervisor with NIC)
- Comprehensive SDKs (Go, Python) with MCP, OpenAI Agents, and LangChain integrations

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables secure, isolated, and fast-booting execution environments for AI agents, critical for scalable and reliable RAG systems.
