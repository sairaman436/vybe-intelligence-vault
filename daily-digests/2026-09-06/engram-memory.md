## Summary
Engram is a self-hosted Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI agents with persistent, structured memory across sessions. It uses Markdown files as the source of truth, combining hybrid search (BM25 + embeddings) with typed graph relations to enable efficient knowledge retrieval and organization.

## Key Features
- Hybrid search combining BM25, embeddings, and exact-match channels for high-precision retrieval
- Typed graph relations with bidirectional linking for structured knowledge navigation
- Bi-temporal versioning for tracking changes and superseded entries without data loss
- Schema-enforced entry types and integrity checks via the `doctor` tool
- Self-hosted deployment with Docker, supporting multiple transports (stdio, SSE, HTTP)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Engram provides a critical layer for RAG systems by enabling AI agents to retain and retrieve structured knowledge across sessions, reducing redundant context generation and improving decision-making efficiency.
