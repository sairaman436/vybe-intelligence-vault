## Summary
mcp-gauntlet is a regression testing suite for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that dynamically evaluates tool definitions, descriptions, outputs, and robustness to catch issues like tool poisoning, schema rot, and definition drift that static scanners miss. It runs in CI to validate server integrity and reliability.

## Key Features
- Dynamic testing of MCP servers by calling tools and scanning outputs for poisoning or malformed responses
- Static and runtime security scans for prompt injection and hidden characters in all server-authored strings
- Definition drift detection by comparing `tools/list` responses across sessions
- Robustness checks for malformed input rejection and tool reliability
- Live agent-based task execution to evaluate description quality and agent task success

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It ensures MCP servers are secure, reliable, and agent-ready by catching dynamic and static issues that static scanners and manual reviews miss, preventing production failures and security vulnerabilities.
