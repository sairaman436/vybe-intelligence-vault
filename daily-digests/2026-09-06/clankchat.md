## Summary
clankchat is a local communication layer for coding agents within a Git repository, enabling direct messaging, broadcasts, and request/reply interactions between agents like Claude Code and OpenCode without human relay. It uses SQLite for durable state stored in Git's common directory, ensuring shared conversations across linked worktrees.

## Key Features
- Durable message storage in SQLite under Git's common directory for shared state across worktrees
- Direct messaging, broadcasts, and request/reply interactions between agents (Claude Code, OpenCode)
- Human-readable watch mode for monitoring agent conversations in real-time
- Pinned broadcasts for persistent instructions to all agents in a repository
- Seamless integration with MCP tools for agent-driven interactions

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables seamless, durable, and context-aware communication between AI coding agents within a Git repository, reducing coordination overhead and improving collaborative workflows.
