## Summary
AgentPay Sentinel MCP is a security-focused MCP server that validates agent payment requests against 9 security checks before execution, preventing policy violations, replay attacks, amount tampering, and budget overruns. It provides real-time audits, token integrity verification, and threat simulation for AI agent payment systems.

## Key Features
- Runs 9 pre-flight security checks on payment transactions (token integrity, budget enforcement, merchant allowlist, etc.)
- Simulates attack vectors (replay attacks, amount tampering, revocation evasion) for proactive defense testing
- Returns tamper-evident SHA-256 audit hashes for compliance and record-keeping
- Supports token revocation and nonce management to prevent replay attacks
- Offers free and paid plans with threat model simulations and unlimited audits

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It ensures AI agents cannot execute unauthorized or malicious payment requests by enforcing real-time security checks, critical for building trustworthy and compliant RAG/AI systems.
