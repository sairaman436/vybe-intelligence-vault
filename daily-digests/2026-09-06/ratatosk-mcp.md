## Summary
Ratatosk-MCP is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides AI agents with structured, entity-level facts extracted from CNCF project release notes, including security fixes, breaking changes, and deprecations. It enables agents to query and act on critical upgrade information without requiring API keys or accounts.

## Key Features
- Extracts structured facts (security fixes, breaking changes, deprecations) from CNCF release notes with verbatim quotes as evidence
- Provides MCP-compatible tools for agents to query upgrade paths, project releases, and entity-specific facts
- Supports both hosted and self-hosted deployment with privacy controls (no version data logged in hosted mode)
- Includes audit logging for self-hosted instances to track tool usage and arguments
- Offers local version comparison for `check_stack` to avoid exposing component versions externally

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Ratatosk-MCP delivers critical, actionable release intelligence directly to AI agents, enabling automated upgrade advisories and reducing manual review overhead for CNCF projects.
