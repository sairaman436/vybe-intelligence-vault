## Summary
Samosa Chat enables running the Qwen3.6-35B-A3B large language model locally on a 16GB Apple Silicon Mac without requiring a GPU or cloud services. It provides a terminal-based and web-based interface for interactive chat, leveraging a custom C-based inference engine and group-32 quantization to optimize memory usage.

## Key Features
- Runs 35B-parameter Qwen3.6 model on 16GB RAM Macs using group-32 quantization and expert caching
- Provides both terminal and web-based chat interfaces with streaming token output
- Atomic installer with SHA-256 verification, rollback support, and resumeable downloads
- No GPU or cloud dependency; runs entirely on CPU with Apple Silicon native support
- Supports conversation resuming via atomic snapshots and deterministic sampling

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Samosa Chat demonstrates how to efficiently run large language models on resource-constrained hardware, offering a blueprint for optimizing memory and storage usage in local AI deployments.
