## Summary
OpenMeetNote is a local-first meeting recorder that captures dual-track audio, transcribes it using two engines (live and final), and generates verifiable summaries with citations. It enforces rigorous validation to prevent hallucinations and ensures every fact is backed by verbatim transcript evidence.

## Key Features
- Dual-track audio capture (system + microphone) with real-time and final transcription engines
- Rigorous citation verification: every fact must match a verbatim transcript segment with hash validation
- Energy-adaptive VAD thresholding to handle varying room noise levels
- Local-only processing with no telemetry or network calls
- Modular model loading with environment variable overrides for flexibility

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a robust, locally verifiable pipeline for generating accurate meeting summaries with citations, reducing hallucinations in RAG systems by enforcing evidence-based outputs.
