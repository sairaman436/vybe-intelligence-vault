## Summary
sshboard is a Tauri-based desktop application that provides an MCP-compatible SFTP client and SSH terminal, enabling AI agents to view remote server files and command outputs alongside human users over a single SSH session. It focuses on read-only operations to safely integrate AI into traditional server maintenance workflows.

## Key Features
- Built-in MCP server for AI agent integration without separate processes
- Shared terminal and file panes between humans and AI over a single SSH session
- Read-only command execution with strict allowlist-based permissions via `readonly.toml`
- Cross-platform support for macOS and Windows with Tauri
- Minisign-verified updates and OS credential store integration for secure authentication

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It eliminates the need for humans to manually relay server state to AI agents during maintenance, enabling seamless AI-assisted troubleshooting without exposing servers to write operations.
