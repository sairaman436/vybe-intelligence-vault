## Summary
VoiceLayer provides local-first voice input/output capabilities for AI coding assistants via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It enables real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech interactions with sub-1.5 second latency, eliminating cloud dependencies and API keys.

## Key Features
- Local-first voice processing with whisper.cpp for STT and edge-tts for TTS, ensuring no data leaves the user's machine
- Daemon architecture with Unix socket IPC for efficient resource usage and reduced process overhead
- 11 MCP-compatible tools (2 core + 9 aliases) with ToolAnnotations for seamless AI agent integration
- Silero VAD for speech detection and configurable recording controls (push-to-talk, timeout, VAD thresholds)
- Cross-platform support via VoiceBar (macOS SwiftUI app) and MCP client integration for AI coding assistants

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
VoiceLayer enables AI agents to interact via voice with minimal latency and no cloud dependencies, making it essential for building responsive, privacy-focused RAG systems.
