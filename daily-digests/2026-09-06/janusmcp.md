## Summary
JanusMCP is a local multi-account tool broker for AI agents, enabling seamless credential management and identity switching across multiple accounts for the same service without reconnecting. It supports both MCP and CLI modes, allowing agents to access tools on demand with credentials securely stored in the OS keychain.

## Key Features
- Multi-account support for the same service with seamless identity switching
- Dual-mode operation: MCP server and CLI-driven tool invocation
- Secure credential storage via OS keychain with OAuth loopback support
- Per-session or global identity scoping with configurable binding modes
- On-demand tool discovery and invocation to minimize context overhead

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
JanusMCP solves the critical problem of multi-account tool access for AI agents, enabling secure, scalable, and context-efficient interactions with multiple identities across services without manual reconnection or reauthentication.
