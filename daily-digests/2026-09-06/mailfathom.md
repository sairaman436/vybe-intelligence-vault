## Summary
MailFathom transforms IMAP mailboxes into a self-hosted, AI-native service by synchronizing emails into a local PostgreSQL database, indexing them for search, and exposing them to AI agents via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It enables read-only access today with plans for semantic retrieval, answering, and future write capabilities.

## Key Features
- Read-only synchronization of IMAP mailboxes into a local PostgreSQL database without marking emails as read
- Lexical search and retrieval of emails via MCP tools (`list_emails`, `search_emails`, `get_email_content`)
- Secure by default with explicit weakening options, secret provisioning, and transport security
- Enterprise-grade deployment with hardened container images, multi-architecture support, and verifiable supply chain
- Modular monolith architecture with strict boundaries, compiler-enforced diagnostics, and comprehensive testing

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
MailFathom provides a critical infrastructure layer for RAG systems by enabling secure, self-hosted access to large email archives, ensuring data privacy and control while exposing mail as structured, searchable content for AI agents.
