## Summary
etwin-bot is a single-user, proactive Telegram companion that periodically wakes, gathers conversation context, and uses an LLM (Claude or Codex) to decide whether to initiate interaction. It enforces deterministic owner overrides, supports swappable backends, and prioritizes model-led cadence with a focus on personalization and security.

## Key Features
- Model-led proactive messaging with configurable intervals and LLM-driven decisions
- Swappable backends (Claude Agent SDK or Codex) with instance-specific configurations
- Deterministic owner override via `/quiet` command blocking proactive ticks for 24 hours
- Personal persona customization through gitignored `.local.md` files and persona templates
- Secure single-user boundary enforced via `ALICE_CHAT_ID` and strict permission checks

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a robust framework for building personalized, proactive AI companions with model-led decision-making and secure single-user boundaries, critical for privacy-focused RAG applications.
