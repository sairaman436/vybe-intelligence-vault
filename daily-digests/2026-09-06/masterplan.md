## Summary
masterplan is a CLI plugin for Claude Code and Codex CLI that orchestrates a durable multi-phase development lifecycle (brainstorm → plan → execute → finish) using the obra/superpowers skills suite. It ensures state persistence on disk, enabling seamless resumption after crashes or session compactions.

## Key Features
- Durable state management with disk-based run bundles (`docs/masterplan/<slug>/`)
- Deterministic planning via LLM-generated task fragments merged into a canonical `plan.index.json`
- Wave-based execution with scope verification and out-of-scope file reverts
- Automatic finish flow with verification, retrospective, and branch-finish gate
- Doctor module for structural linting and repair across run bundles

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a robust, stateful orchestration layer for AI-driven development workflows, ensuring continuity and reliability in long-running engineering tasks.
