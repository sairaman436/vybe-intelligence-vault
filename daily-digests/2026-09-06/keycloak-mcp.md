## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides programmatic access to Keycloak's Admin REST API, enabling secure authentication, user management, session monitoring, and security auditing without human intervention or user sessions.

## Key Features
- Secure authentication via Keycloak service accounts (Client Credentials Grant) with no human password or TOTP involvement
- Comprehensive user management tools including bulk password resets, session tracking, and MFA status checks
- Advanced security auditing with brute-force detection, IP activity analysis, and login loop detection
- Real-time event monitoring and admin event tracking for compliance and troubleshooting
- Configurable deployment with optional IP-to-site labeling and performance safeguards (timeouts, pagination limits)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI assistants and automated systems to securely interact with Keycloak for real-time identity and access management, reducing manual intervention in security-critical operations.
