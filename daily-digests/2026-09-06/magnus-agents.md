## Summary
magnus-agents is a runtime system that enables AI persona agents for the Magnus Minecraft mod by listening to Redis pub/sub channels, generating responses via an OpenAI-compatible API, and publishing signed chat messages back into the Magnus network.

## Key Features
- Listens to Redis channels for real-time chat and player list updates
- Generates responses via OpenAI-compatible APIs with configurable personas
- Supports multi-node chat pipelines with alternate routing (ignore, reply, future actions)
- Uses YAML-based persona configuration for flexible agent behavior
- Tracks cross-server player lists via Magnus heartbeats

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables dynamic AI-driven interactions in Minecraft servers through modular agent personas and Redis-based event handling.
