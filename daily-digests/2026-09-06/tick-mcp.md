## Summary
tick is an MCP time server designed to provide accurate, real-time clock functionality for AI assistants, addressing issues like stale timestamps and hallucinated time references in long-running sessions. It offers local, remote, and hook-based implementations to integrate with various MCP clients.

## Key Features
- Provides real-time `now` and recency-checking `since` tools to prevent AI hallucinations about time
- Offers local (stdio), remote (HTTP), and hook-based implementations for flexibility
- Enforces time-checking via tool descriptions and user memory rules to ensure compliance
- Zero-dependency design with single-file implementations for easy setup
- Supports IANA timezones and integrates with Claude Desktop, Code, and claude.ai

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
tick ensures AI assistants maintain accurate time awareness, reducing hallucinations and improving reliability in long-running or multi-day interactions.
