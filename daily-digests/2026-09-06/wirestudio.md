## Summary
WireStudio is a hardware design tool for ESPHome devices that generates multiple artifacts (ESPHome YAML, KiCad schematics/PCB, wiring diagrams, JLCPCB fab bundles, and 3D-printable enclosures) from a single `design.json` file. It includes advanced features like a CSP pin solver, electrical validation, and LoRaWAN firmware building/flashing capabilities.

## Key Features
- Single-source design file (`design.json`) drives all outputs: ESPHome YAML, KiCad schematics/PCB, wiring diagrams, and 3D-printable enclosures
- CSP-based pin solver assigns legal pins while validating electrical constraints (voltage rails, current draw, pull-ups, ADC2-WiFi conflicts)
- Supports two LoRaWAN firmware paths: standalone RadioLib+LoRaWAN_ESP32 flashing and ESPHome YAML integration with `lorawan-for-esphome`
- Automated PCB autorouting via Freerouting with CI-gated verification and DRC checks
- Integrated MCP server for AI agent-driven design workflows and fleet deployment via `fleet-for-esphome`

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
WireStudio streamlines the hardware design process for ESPHome devices by automating artifact generation from a single source, reducing errors and accelerating development for AI-driven embedded systems.
