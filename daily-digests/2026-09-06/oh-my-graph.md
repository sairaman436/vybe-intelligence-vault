## Summary
oh-my-graph is a persistent knowledge graph server designed to maintain AI agent context across sessions by storing project understanding as nodes and edges in an append-only log. It enables agents to build on prior discoveries, decisions, and messages without re-explaining context.

## Key Features
- Append-only WAL storage for nodes and edges with never-modified records
- Shared knowledge across concurrent AI agents via topic-based graphs
- MCP-compatible HTTP server for seamless integration with AI clients
- Visual graph exploration and interactive force-directed rendering
- Asynchronous messaging via `message` nodes and `replies_to` edges

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It eliminates the need for AI agents to rediscover project context in every session, enabling continuous learning and collaboration across time and agents.
