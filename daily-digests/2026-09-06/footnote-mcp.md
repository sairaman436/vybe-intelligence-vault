## Summary
An MCP server designed for source-grounded web research, enabling discovery, extraction, and verification of claims against their sources. It prioritizes trustworthiness by validating claims with offline heuristics or LLMs, and supports structured data extraction from tables, APIs, and files.

## Key Features
- 42 tools over stdio MCP for discovery, reading, structured data extraction, and claim verification
- Automated claim validation against source text using offline heuristics or LLMs (Ollama)
- Graceful degradation with no API keys required (scraped search + headless browser fallback)
- Persistent source caching with provenance and research memory
- Sandboxed extraction recipes for controlled parsing of complex or JS-heavy pages

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides critical claim verification and source grounding capabilities essential for building reliable RAG systems that require factual accuracy and traceability.
