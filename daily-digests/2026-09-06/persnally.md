## Summary
Persnally is a local-first personal context engine that learns about users from their AI interactions, code, and other activities to provide personalized context to AI tools. It ensures user data remains private and under their control while enabling AI systems to understand and adapt to individual preferences and history.

## Key Features
- Event-sourced architecture with append-only SQLite storage for full provenance and auditability
- Local-first deployment ensuring user data never leaves the machine (except for optional LLM extraction with user-provided keys)
- MCP server integration for seamless AI tool connectivity (Claude, Cursor, etc.)
- Provenance-complete profile synthesis with evidence-linked claims and one-click deletion
- Decay-weighted interest graph and behavior modeling for dynamic personalization

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Persnally enables AI tools to provide truly personalized and context-aware interactions by maintaining a user's evolving profile locally, reducing redundant context gathering and improving relevance without compromising privacy.
