## Summary
Planr is a local-first planning and execution coordination tool for coding agents that transforms chaotic agent workflows into a verified task graph. It enables agents like Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor to collaborate safely on structured work with dependency-aware planning, atomic task claims, and evidence-backed verification.

## Key Features
- Dependency-aware task graph modeling with atomic task claims to prevent race conditions
- Evidence-backed verification requiring logs, tests, or commands for task closure
- Cross-agent compatibility via CLI, MCP, and plugin integrations (Codex, Claude Code, Cursor)
- State persistence across sessions with Markdown plans and SQLite-backed task graphs
- Automated recovery and sweep tools for stale tasks, timeouts, and retries

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Planr provides a structured, dependency-aware framework for coordinating multiple AI agents and humans on complex tasks, ensuring safe parallel execution and verifiable outcomes essential for reliable RAG and AI-driven workflows.
