## Summary
Ratel is a context engineering layer for AI agents that dynamically selects only the relevant tools or skills for each task, reducing token usage and improving accuracy by avoiding tool overload. It operates without a vector database, using BM25 or optional semantic retrieval for efficient tool indexing.

## Key Features
- Dynamic tool selection via BM25 or semantic retrieval to reduce context bloat
- Multi-language SDKs (TypeScript, Python) for seamless integration
- In-process engine with no external dependencies like vector DBs
- Supports MCP servers and local/managed deployments
- Telemetry and benchmarking tools for performance monitoring

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Ratel directly addresses the critical issue of tool overload in AI agents, significantly reducing costs and improving accuracy by dynamically filtering tools without requiring a vector database.
