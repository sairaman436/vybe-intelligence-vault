## Summary
A lightweight Emacs Lisp harness for enhancing the reliability of gptel agent sessions by adding completion verification and context supervision to prevent premature termination and manage long-running agent workflows.

## Key Features
- Completion supervision to prevent premature agent termination by verifying task completion before allowing FSM transitions to DONE/ERRS states
- Context supervision that monitors and compacts context usage to avoid exceeding model window limits
- Configurable nudging mechanism to prompt agents for verification of incomplete tasks
- Integration with gptel agent FSM and request functions via advice-based extensions
- Support for model-specific context window sizes and custom compaction prompts

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It ensures AI agents complete tasks reliably by verifying completion and managing context, reducing failures in long-running autonomous workflows.
