## Summary
Clippy is a macOS desktop agent that combines screen reading, accessibility tree analysis, and automation to execute user commands by clicking and typing on the user's behalf. It bridges the gap between AI chat and real-world desktop interaction, enabling hands-free task completion while maintaining strict safety guardrails.

## Key Features
- Real-time screen reading and accessibility tree analysis to identify UI elements and their states
- One-step-at-a-time automation with automatic retries and re-planning based on observed changes
- Strict guardrails preventing irreversible actions (e.g., sending, deleting, or entering passwords)
- Integration with existing AI providers (Claude Code, Codex, OpenAI, Anthropic) for natural language processing
- Configurable memory and policy-driven safety checks via Prismor Warden

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Clippy bridges the critical gap between AI chat and real-world desktop interaction, enabling AI assistants to perform tasks autonomously while maintaining strict safety controls, making it essential for building robust RAG systems that require real-world action execution.
