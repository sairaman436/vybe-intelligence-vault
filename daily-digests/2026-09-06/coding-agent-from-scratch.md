## Summary
A minimalist coding agent built from scratch without any agent frameworks, where each component is driven by real-world failures. The project documents every decision, trade-off, and failure to provide empirical insights into agent design and safety.

## Key Features
- Hand-written agent components with real-world failure-driven design
- Empirical documentation of trade-offs and failures for each step
- Shell-based tooling with rigorous safety checks (e.g., `write_file` with `realpath`)
- Progressive hardening against common agent pitfalls (timeouts, hallucinations, process leaks)
- Baseline performance metrics and regression testing without LLM adjustments

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides empirical insights into agent design trade-offs and safety pitfalls, offering a data-driven foundation for building robust RAG systems.
