## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server providing AI agents with cryptographically attested, provenance-verifiable data feeds via PayPerByte. It enables pay-per-call access to real-time data (e.g., weather, security, markets) with EIP-712 receipts for integrity verification, supporting both on-chain subscriptions and x402 pay-per-use models.

## Key Features
- Cryptographically attested data feeds with EIP-712 `PayloadAttestation` receipts for integrity verification
- Dual payment rails: x402 pay-per-call (Base mainnet, real USDC) and on-chain subscriptions (Arbitrum Sepolia, testnet MockUSDC)
- 15 MCP tools for discovery, subscription, publishing, and verification (e.g., `byte_buy_data`, `byte_verify_payload`)
- Zero-setup buy mode with real-time USDC settlement and no API keys required
- Built-in verification tools to ensure data integrity before acting on responses

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a secure, verifiable, and pay-per-use mechanism for AI agents to access real-time data feeds with cryptographic proof of integrity, eliminating trust issues in RAG pipelines.
