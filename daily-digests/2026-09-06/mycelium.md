## Summary
Mycelium is a zero-trust, end-to-end encrypted messaging layer designed for secure communication between Claude Code instances. It ensures messages remain unreadable even if the relay is compromised, using ephemeral keys, Ed25519 signatures, and Curve25519 for perfect forward secrecy.

## Key Features
- Zero-trust architecture with no plaintext exposure even if relay is compromised
- Perfect forward secrecy via ephemeral Curve25519 keys per session
- TOFU (Trust-on-First-Use) identity pinning with out-of-band verification
- End-to-end delivery acknowledgements for unicast messages with 30s timeout
- Multi-relay failover support for high availability

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Mycelium provides a secure, zero-trust messaging layer critical for protecting sensitive AI workflows and Claude Code integrations from relay-based attacks.
