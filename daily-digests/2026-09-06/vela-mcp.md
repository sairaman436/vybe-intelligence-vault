## Summary
Vela MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes Vela RemotePC endpoints as tools, enabling AI clients like Claude, Cline, or Cursor to control remote systems via standardized tool calls.

## Key Features
- Supports both STDIO (single-tenant) and HTTP (multi-tenant) transport modes for flexible deployment
- Exposes 150+ MCP tools for remote system control without modification to tool definitions
- Enforces multi-tenancy via relay server validation of agent credentials per request
- Configurable via environment variables or client-provided headers/URLs for credential management
- Includes development tools like MCP Inspector for testing and debugging

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It bridges AI models with remote system control capabilities, enabling secure and scalable orchestration of devices for AI-driven automation and operations.
