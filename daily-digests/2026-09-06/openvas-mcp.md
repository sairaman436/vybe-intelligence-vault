## Summary
A self-hosted MCP server that provides AI agents with structured access to OpenVAS/Greenbone vulnerability scanning capabilities. It acts as a secure bridge between AI systems and GVM instances, enabling local-first vulnerability assessments without exposing credentials or sending data externally.

## Key Features
- Local-first architecture ensuring no external data exposure or telemetry
- Credential isolation via a single GVM service account managed by the MCP server
- Structured scan data output for seamless AI agent integration
- Support for multiple transport protocols (stdio, SSE, streamable-http)
- Comprehensive security practices including signed releases, SBOMs, and egress auditing

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to securely and locally perform vulnerability assessments without exposing credentials or sending sensitive data to external services, bridging the gap between AI-driven security operations and robust vulnerability scanning tools.
