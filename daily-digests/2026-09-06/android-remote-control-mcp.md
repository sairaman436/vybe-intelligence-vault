## Summary
An Android application that functions as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, enabling AI models to remotely control an Android device via accessibility services, screenshots, and 56 MCP tools across 13 categories. Runs entirely on-device with optional HTTPS, OAuth, and remote access tunnels for internet connectivity.

## Key Features
- 56 MCP tools across 13 categories (screen introspection, gestures, file operations, app management, etc.)
- Runs entirely on-device with no ADB dependency, enabling remote control over the internet via tunnels
- Optimized for token efficiency with compact screen state representation, configurable screenshot quality, and per-tool enable/disable
- Supports OAuth 2.1 for secure AI client connections (Claude.ai/Code) and bearer token authentication
- Auto-start on boot, foreground service, and headless setup via ADB for seamless integration

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI models to directly interact with and control Android devices in real-time, reducing latency and dependency on external tools like ADB while optimizing token usage for agentic workflows.
