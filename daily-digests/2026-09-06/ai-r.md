## Summary
ai-r is a read-only tool that audits and analyzes session histories from multiple coding agents (Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Antigravity, Pi) to verify agent actions, detect risky commands, and extract structured entities like plans, intents, and authorship. It normalizes disparate agent log formats into a unified interface for auditing, memory building, and cross-agent continuity.

## Key Features
- Normalizes session logs from 5+ coding agents into a unified, agent-neutral stream
- Detects and flags dangerous commands (e.g., `rm -rf`, `curl|sh`) with optional rollback confirmation
- Extracts and compares plans vs. actual edits to verify agent adherence to intent
- Provides structured entities (plans, intents, authorship) for memory systems and audits
- Offers MCP server, CLI, and Python SDK for programmatic access and integration

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
ai-r provides critical auditing and verification capabilities for RAG/AI stacks by ensuring agent actions are transparent, traceable, and free from hidden risks or misalignments.
