## Summary
HiveShare is a collaborative AI memory system that enables engineering teams to share and reuse AI-processed context across tools like Claude Code and Cursor. It stores processed context in isolated 'hiveshares' per project, allowing agents to immediately access and build upon previous work without re-reading or re-summarizing.

## Key Features
- Isolated hiveshares per project or sprint with fine-grained access control
- Real-time live sync via SSE for immediate context sharing among teammates
- Hybrid semantic and full-text search with OpenAI/Ollama embeddings or PostgreSQL fallback
- MCP integration for seamless use with Claude Code, Cursor, and other AI tools
- Version history, snapshots, rollback, and metrics for collaboration tracking

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
HiveShare eliminates redundant AI context processing by enabling teams to share and reuse processed memory, significantly improving efficiency and consistency in AI-driven engineering workflows.
