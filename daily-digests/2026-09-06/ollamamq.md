## Summary
ollamaMQ is a high-performance, asynchronous message queue dispatcher and load balancer designed to proxy and optimize requests to Ollama or LM Studio API instances. It intelligently routes, queues, and balances requests across multiple backends using advanced scheduling and model-aware routing.

## Key Features
- Multi-backend load balancing with least-connections and round-robin scheduling
- Model-aware routing that prioritizes backends with the requested model already loaded in GPU memory
- Per-user FIFO queuing and fair-share scheduling to prevent monopolization
- Real-time TUI dashboard for monitoring backend health, queue depths, and throughput
- Admin API for dynamic model loading/unloading and backend health checks

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It optimizes and scales LLM inference workloads by intelligently routing requests to the most suitable backend, reducing latency and improving resource utilization for RAG and AI pipelines.
