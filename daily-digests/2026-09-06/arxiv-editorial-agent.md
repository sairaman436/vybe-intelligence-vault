## Summary
A 100% local AI agent that monitors arXiv, downloads papers, extracts the first page as an image, and generates Twitter threads using a local LLM (llama.cpp) without cloud APIs. The pipeline includes PDF processing, gatekeeping, and thread generation entirely on consumer GPUs.

## Key Features
- Fully local inference with llama.cpp (no cloud APIs or API keys required)
- Automated arXiv paper monitoring, PDF download, and first-page screenshot extraction
- Gatekeeper LLM validation to filter relevant papers before thread generation
- Configurable thread generation with PyMuPDF for text and image extraction
- Hardware-optimized deployment with CUDA and FlashAttention for low-VRAM GPUs

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables fully local, automated transformation of academic papers into engaging social media content, reducing dependency on cloud services while leveraging consumer GPUs for efficient LLM inference.
