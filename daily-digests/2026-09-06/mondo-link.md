## Summary
Mondo-link is an MCP server that provides a local, queryable SQLite index for the Mondo Disease Ontology, enabling fast disease-term lookup, hierarchical traversal, and cross-ontology mapping without relying on upstream APIs or rate limits.

## Key Features
- Precomputed SQLite index with full-text search and transitive `is_a` closure for disease hierarchies
- Cross-ontology mapping support (OMIM, Orphanet, DOID, NCIT, UMLS, MeSH, MONDO) with ranked predicates
- Offline, fast lookups with no upstream rate-limiting or throttling
- Atomic build process with provenance tracking and conditional downloads (ETag/Last-Modified)
- Supports both HTTP and stdio MCP transport for integration with AI agents and tools

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a critical, locally queryable interface to the Mondo Disease Ontology, enabling reliable and fast disease-term resolution and hierarchical traversal for RAG and AI systems without dependency on external APIs.
