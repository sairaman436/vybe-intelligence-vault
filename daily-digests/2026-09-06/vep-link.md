## Summary
vep-link is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides a unified interface to the Ensembl REST API's Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) and Variant Recoder, enabling annotation and recoding of genetic variants across human reference assemblies GRCh38 and GRCh37.

## Key Features
- Unified interface for variant annotation and recoding across GRCh38 and GRCh37
- Normalization of variant inputs (rsID, HGVS, VCF, SPDI) to canonical CHR-POS-REF-ALT format
- Batch processing with rate-limiting and circuit-breaking for Ensembl API resilience
- Four response modes to tailor output detail for model needs
- Live API integration with provenance tracking and citation requirements

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It simplifies access to Ensembl's VEP and Variant Recoder for AI models by providing a single, normalized interface, reducing complexity and improving efficiency in variant annotation workflows.
