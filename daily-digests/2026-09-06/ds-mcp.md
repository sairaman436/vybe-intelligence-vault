## Summary
ds-mcp is a read-only MCP server that exposes a design system's contract (dspack file) as queryable tools for AI agents, ensuring generated UI adheres to documented patterns, tokens, and constraints without manual correction.

## Key Features
- Read-only MCP server exposing design system metadata as queryable tools for AI agents
- Supports dspack v0.1–v0.4 contracts for tokens, components, patterns, and anti-patterns
- Provides governed generation context and surface validation for AI-driven UI generation
- Zero-network, no-write architecture ensuring security and reliability
- Integrates with MCP clients (Claude, Cursor, etc.) for real-time design system queries

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to generate UI that strictly adheres to a team's documented design system, reducing manual correction overhead and ensuring consistency.
