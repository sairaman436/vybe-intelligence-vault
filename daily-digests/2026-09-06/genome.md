## Summary
GENOME provides an open-source, offline-capable memory layer for AI agents that matches Mem0's answer accuracy while reducing storage costs by ~1,000x. It embeds messages locally with zero LLM calls, enabling fast (~10ms), air-gapped, and auditable memory storage for agent frameworks.

## Key Features
- Zero LLM calls for memory storage, reducing costs by ~1,000x compared to alternatives like Mem0
- Fully offline and air-gapped operation with local embeddings and SQLite storage
- Bi-temporal memory support for point-in-time queries (e.g., 'what was true in March?')
- MCP server integration for cross-session memory in agents like Claude Desktop or Cursor
- Honest benchmarking against Mem0 using public datasets (LoCoMo, LongMemEval) with parity in accuracy

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
GENOME enables RAG and AI agents to store and retrieve memories at near-zero cost and latency while maintaining offline and auditable operations, making it ideal for production deployments in regulated or resource-constrained environments.
