## Summary
A grounded RAG-based support agent for travel agencies that answers customer queries using company policy documents while strictly refusing to speculate. It classifies queries, retrieves relevant policies with citations, verifies answer groundedness, and escalates to humans when uncertain.

## Key Features
- Classifies user queries into policy, booking, human, or off-topic categories
- Retrieves policy documents with citations and verifies answer groundedness
- Implements a retry loop for retrieval if answers aren't fully supported
- Structured escalation to human agents with handoff tickets
- Modular design with injectable dependencies for testing and customization

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
This agent framework demonstrates critical RAG best practices like citation verification, groundedness checks, and escalation policies, making it essential for building reliable AI support systems.
