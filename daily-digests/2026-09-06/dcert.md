## Summary
dcert is a Rust-based CLI and MCP server for X.509 certificate analysis, validation, and conversion. It supports reading certificates from PEM files or HTTPS endpoints, validating TLS connections, checking revocation status, converting between formats (e.g., PFX to PEM), and integrating with AI-powered IDEs via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Key Features
- Decodes and validates X.509 certificates from PEM files or HTTPS endpoints
- Converts between certificate formats (e.g., PFX to PEM)
- Checks certificate expiry, revocation status, and compliance with CA/B Forum Baseline Requirements
- Integrates with AI-powered IDEs via MCP for real-time certificate analysis
- Supports HashiCorp Vault PKI for certificate issuance, renewal, and revocation

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
dcert provides essential TLS certificate validation and analysis capabilities critical for ensuring security and reliability in AI and RAG pipelines that interact with HTTPS endpoints.
