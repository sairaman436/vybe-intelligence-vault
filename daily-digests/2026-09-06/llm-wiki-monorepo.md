## Summary
A production-grade knowledge engine that transforms raw documents into persistent, cross-linked Markdown wikis using AI agents. It compiles sources incrementally, maintains a knowledge graph with community detection, and supports hybrid search, concurrency control, and modular architecture for agent-native workflows.

## Key Features
- Two-step ingest with SHA256 caching and multi-provider LLM support (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, agent-native modes)
- Knowledge graph engine with Louvain community detection, bitemporal edges, and derived-edge layers
- Hybrid search (BM25 + semantic KNN via RRF) with gold-set certification and keyword fallback
- Concurrency control with atomic writes, advisory locking, and conflict management
- MCP server with 14 stdio tools for programmatic wiki access and integration with AI clients

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a complete, agent-native pipeline for compiling raw documents into persistent, structured knowledge bases that can be queried efficiently, eliminating the need for repeated document retrieval in RAG systems.
