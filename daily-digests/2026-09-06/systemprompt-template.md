## Summary
A self-hosted Rust-based governance and orchestration layer for AI agents that provides authentication, authorization, secret detection, rate limiting, and auditing for AI interactions. Designed for SOC 2, ISO 27001, and HIPAA compliance with a single binary and PostgreSQL dependency.

## Key Features
- Single Rust binary with PostgreSQL for all AI governance operations
- In-process governance pipeline with sub-5ms overhead (JWT validation, RBAC, secret detection, blocklists, rate limiting)
- Credential injection via environment variables only (parent process never touches secrets)
- 43 scripted demos validating security, performance, and compliance claims
- Built-in audit table with 18 columns for identity, scope, tool calls, costs, and deny reasons

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a critical governance layer for RAG/AI stacks, ensuring secure, auditable, and compliant AI agent interactions without relying on external SaaS services.
