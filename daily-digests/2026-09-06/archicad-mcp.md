## Summary
MCP server that bridges AI assistants with Archicad via the Tapir JSON API, enabling automation through Python scripting. It exposes 173 Archicad commands as a single `execute_script` tool, allowing AI to write complex, multi-step workflows with full async access and dynamic documentation.

## Key Features
- Single `execute_script` tool for all 173 Archicad commands, enabling complex multi-step workflows in a single round-trip
- Dynamic documentation generation from live Archicad schemas, ensuring accuracy and reducing stale docs
- Multi-instance discovery and support for parallel Archicad projects via port scanning
- Full-text search with typo tolerance for command discovery and property lookups
- Security modes (unrestricted/sandboxed) with configurable file access restrictions

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI assistants to directly automate and query Archicad projects through a unified scripting interface, reducing tool fragmentation and simplifying complex workflows for architecture and engineering teams.
