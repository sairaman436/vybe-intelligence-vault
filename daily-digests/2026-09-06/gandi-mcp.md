## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Gandi LiveDNS that enables DNS record management, domain listing, and zone snapshots directly from MCP-compatible clients like Claude Code. It provides secure, timestamped backups for all DNS mutations and integrates seamlessly with Gandi's API.

## Key Features
- 8 MCP tools for DNS operations (list, add, update, delete records, manage snapshots)
- Automatic local JSON backups before every DNS mutation with configurable auto-backup
- One-file JSON configuration with strict permissions (0600) for secure API key storage
- Supports Gandi Personal Access Tokens (PATs) with scoped domain permissions
- Integration with Claude Code and other MCP clients for seamless DNS automation

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables secure, automated DNS management within AI workflows, reducing manual intervention and improving reliability for RAG systems that rely on accurate DNS configurations.
