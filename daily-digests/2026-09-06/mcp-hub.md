## Summary
mcp-hub is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) gateway that consolidates multiple stdio MCP servers into a single containerized service, supporting both MCP revisions (2026-07-28 and 2025-11-25) and enabling features like elicitation and subscriptions. It provides path-based routing, OAuth 2.1 authentication, and tool filtering for secure and scalable MCP server aggregation.

## Key Features
- Dual-era MCP support (2026-07-28 and 2025-11-25) with seamless client compatibility
- Path-based routing and `/hub` aggregate for centralized tool access
- Built-in OAuth 2.1 authentication and API token support for secure client access
- Tool filtering (allow/deny) for granular access control to MCP server tools
- On-demand lifecycle management with idle timeouts and hot reload for stdio servers

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It simplifies the deployment and management of multiple MCP servers by consolidating them into a single, secure, and scalable gateway, reducing infrastructure overhead while enabling advanced features like elicitation and subscriptions for RAG builders.
