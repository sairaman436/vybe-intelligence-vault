## Summary
Chancery is a self-hosted identity provider for AI agents that enforces strict delegation, revocation, and tamper-evident auditing. It ensures agents operate with immutable identities, restricted authority, and secure credential management, preventing prompt injection and unauthorized actions.

## Key Features
- Immutable agent identities with revocable instances and owner attribution
- Writs-based authority delegation that cannot be widened, only restricted
- In-path enforcement for MCP servers with real-time policy checks
- Tamper-evident audit trails that agents cannot modify
- Sealed credentials injected into tool servers, not agent contexts

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Chancery provides critical identity, authority, and audit controls for AI agents, ensuring secure and accountable operations in RAG and agentic systems.
