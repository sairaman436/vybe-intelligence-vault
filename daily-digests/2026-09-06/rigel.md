## Summary
Rigel is a Rust-based CLI agent that enables conversational interactions with OpenAI-compatible LLM APIs while integrating secure, atomic filesystem tools within a restricted workspace context. It supports both local and remote MCP servers for extensibility.

## Key Features
- Secure workspace-restricted filesystem operations with atomic actions
- Support for both local (stdio) and remote (HTTP) MCP servers
- Deterministic model selection and conversation management
- Atomic filesystem tools (create, read, patch, delete, search, etc.)
- Configurable via TOML with strict path validation

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Rigel provides a secure, extensible CLI framework for building AI agents that interact with LLMs while safely managing filesystem operations, critical for RAG pipelines requiring controlled data access.
