## Summary
Nacre is a self-hosted knowledge index with fine-grained access control for AI agents and applications. It ensures agents only access documents they are permitted to see while maintaining auditability and security.

## Key Features
- Fine-grained access control with inherited permissions (workspace → layers → documents)
- Pre-filtering access during HNSW traversal for accurate top_k results
- MCP and REST API support with streamable HTTP and STDIO transport
- Bring-your-own-embeddings with model switching and recall validation
- Self-hosted deployment with Docker Compose and no external dependencies

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Nacre provides a critical security layer for RAG systems by ensuring agents only access permitted documents while maintaining auditability and fine-grained control over knowledge access.
