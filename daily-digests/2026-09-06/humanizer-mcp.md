## Summary
MCP server providing psycholinguistic and structural rules to analyze and improve the human-likeness of written content. It offers deterministic compliance checks for natural language generation without rewriting text, ensuring prose reads as human-authored rather than machine-generated.

## Key Features
- Deterministic compliance checker for human-like prose (e.g., flags em-dashes, banned phrases, sentence structures)
- Psycholinguistic and lexical rule sets (foundation, lexical, structural, sentiment, discourse cohesion)
- Content profile adjustments for different content types (e.g., marketing, technical writing)
- Self-review rubric for models to evaluate their own drafts for human-likeness
- Stateless, read-only MCP server with no runtime write tools or auth

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides essential psycholinguistic and structural rules for ensuring AI-generated content reads naturally, critical for RAG systems producing human-like responses.
