## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that caches and serves GitHub starred repositories locally via SQLite, enabling offline-friendly searches and listings from any MCP-compatible client.

## Key Features
- Zero-config freshness with ETag-based conditional requests to minimize API calls
- Local SQLite cache for instant, offline-friendly reads of starred repositories
- No native dependencies; uses Node.js built-in modules
- Supports multiple authentication methods (GITHUB_TOKEN, .env, or GitHub CLI)
- Provides MCP tools for searching, listing, and retrieving star details

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI engineers to integrate GitHub starred repositories directly into their MCP clients for seamless, offline-capable retrieval and search.
