## Summary
GenieClaw is a low-latency, limited-context AI harness designed for private on-device homes, specifically optimized for NVIDIA Jetson Orin hardware. It enables fast, accurate, and privacy-preserving local AI agents by leveraging deterministic grounding, family memory, and device state within a 4096-token context window.

## Key Features
- 4096-token Jetson baseline for local context with strict BFCL scoring
- Deterministic prompt assembly and memory retrieval for accuracy
- SQLite-based conversation history and family/household memory
- Home Assistant adapter with safety policies, rate limits, and audit logging
- Portable provider architecture with optional cloud escalation (opt-in)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
GenieClaw enables RAG builders to create fast, private, and accurate on-device AI agents by leveraging deterministic grounding and tight hardware constraints, eliminating the need for cloud dependency while maintaining high accuracy.
