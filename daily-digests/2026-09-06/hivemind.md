## Summary
HiveMind is a local MCP server that provides persistent memory for AI coding agents like Claude Code, enabling context, preferences, and project knowledge to persist across sessions via a libsql-backed SQLite database. It injects project-specific memories at session start and offers on-demand recall tools.

## Key Features
- Persistent memory store for AI agents using libsql-backed SQLite database
- Automatic session-start context injection with token budget control via `.hivemind.toml`
- On-demand memory recall, search, and tagging tools (MCP-compatible)
- Cross-client compatibility with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, OpenCode, Kimi, and Codex
- Optional dashboard and REST API for memory management and visualization

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
HiveMind enables AI coding agents to retain project-specific context and preferences across sessions without token overhead, significantly improving continuity and efficiency in RAG workflows.
