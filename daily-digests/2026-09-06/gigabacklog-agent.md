## Summary
A Russian-language demo agent for processing internal service requests, designed to assist specialists by finding similar past cases, generating structured recommendations, and logging decisions for audit. It operates in offline mode by default but supports integration with GigaChat for live LLM processing.

## Key Features
- Structured recommendation generation for internal requests with human-in-the-loop validation
- Offline and live LLM modes with strict JSON schema validation for tool calls
- Secure audit trail with provenance tracking and SQLite storage
- Integration with LangGraph for explicit state management and workflow control
- Demonstration of prompt-injection protection via input/output separation

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a practical example of a secure, auditable agent workflow for internal request processing that balances automation with human oversight, relevant for RAG builders focusing on enterprise-grade AI systems.
