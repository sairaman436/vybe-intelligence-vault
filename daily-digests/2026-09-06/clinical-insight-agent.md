## Summary
An AI agent that performs end-to-end data science over a dbt-modeled healthcare data warehouse, answering plain-English questions with rigorous statistical modeling, guardrails, and self-verification. It integrates synthetic EHR data, a governed dbt pipeline, and a Streamlit UI to deliver reproducible, PHI-free analyses with Word report exports.

## Key Features
- End-to-end statistical analysis from plain-English questions, including model selection, data preparation, assumption diagnostics, and guardrail checks
- Automated SQL generation with self-healing retries and read-only execution, plus lineage tracing and data-quality pre-flight checks
- Supports 15+ statistical models (regression, survival, causal inference, forecasting, A/B testing, power analysis, Bayesian methods) with deterministic guardrails for confidence intervals, FDR correction, and confounding detection
- Built-in vocabulary resolver for clinical terms (e.g., 'heart attack' → SNOMED codes) and cohort filtering to avoid empty-set analyses
- Word report export, monitoring dashboard, Docker support, and keyless local-model compatibility (Ollama/Llama3.1)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It bridges the gap between LLM-driven SQL tools and rigorous statistical analysis, ensuring AI-generated insights are grounded in valid, reproducible, and clinically meaningful modeling with built-in guardrails.
