## Summary
Agentic Memory is an MCP-compliant memory server for AI agents that provides a persistent, bitemporal, and injection-safe memory system with six layered memory types. It enables non-destructive belief revision, safe context synthesis, and multi-tenant namespace isolation for coding agents like Claude Code, Cursor, and Antigravity.

## Key Features
- Six-layer memory architecture (sensory, working, episodic, semantic, long-term, procedural) with unified retrieval
- Non-destructive belief revision with full audit history and contradiction flagging
- Injection-safe context synthesis with trust-level enforcement and tag escaping
- Multi-tenant namespace isolation via Row-Level Security (PostgreSQL) or app-layer filters (SQLite)
- Dual backend support (SQLite for zero-dependency use, PostgreSQL+pgvector for scalable deployments)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a robust, secure, and scalable memory system essential for building reliable and context-aware AI agents that require persistent, non-destructive memory management.
