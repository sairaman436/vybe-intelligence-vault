## Summary
An MCP server that reverse-engineers a locked rebuild specification (CLAUDE.md, .claude config, and mutation-tested tests) from an existing application, enabling coding agents to rebuild it reliably without ambiguity. It does not perform the rebuild itself but produces the contracts and tests needed for a separate agent to execute the rebuild cleanly.

## Key Features
- Reverse-engineers a locked rebuild spec (CLAUDE.md, .claude config) from an existing app without executing it
- Generates mutation-tested test suites to ensure behavioral equivalence
- Mechanically enforces contracts and rules via hooks (e.g., blocking edits to spec/, preventing untested contract builds)
- Interactive ambiguity resolution with MCP elicitation to avoid silent auto-resolution of critical decisions
- Produces a clean sibling directory with all artifacts for a fresh rebuild agent to consume

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a critical missing piece for reliable agentic app rebuilds by generating enforceable specifications and tests that prevent silent behavioral drift, addressing a major failure mode in current AI-driven development pipelines.
