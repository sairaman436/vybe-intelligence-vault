## Summary
A reusable Agent Skill for Cursor and Claude Code that enforces a spec-first workflow (Planner → Builder → Judge) to prevent coding agents from drifting off-task. It requires explicit human approval, bounds execution to the approved scope, and judges results based on verifiable evidence rather than self-reported completion.

## Key Features
- Enforces a three-phase workflow: Planner, Builder, and Judge to ensure task clarity and execution bounds.
- Requires explicit human approval before implementation to prevent scope creep.
- Judge phase evaluates results using verifiable evidence (diffs, logs, tests) rather than self-reported completion.
- Cross-platform support for Cursor and Claude Code with automated validation to ensure consistency.
- Deliberately conservative design that stops workflow on failure rather than entering blind recursive repair loops.

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a structured, human-in-the-loop approach to prevent coding agents from drifting off-task, ensuring reliable and verifiable outcomes for complex AI-driven development workflows.
