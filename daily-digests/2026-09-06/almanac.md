## Summary
Almanac is a local-first desktop agent that synthesizes a grounded daily briefing from your Gmail, Google Calendar, and Slack data. It processes all content on-device, classifies items, and ensures every briefed item links back to its exact source, prioritizing privacy and data ownership.

## Key Features
- Local-first processing with compile-time guarantees to prevent raw data serialization or network transmission
- Four-layer grounding enforcement (memory, wire, disk, render) to ensure every briefed item links back to its exact source
- Hybrid classification pipeline combining high-precision rules and on-device embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 via ONNX)
- Swappable synthesis backend (Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct via Candle) with templated rationales for explainability
- Cross-source deduplication and DST-aware briefing scoping to avoid noise and redundant items

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Almanac demonstrates how to build a privacy-preserving, grounded RAG agent that processes sensitive data entirely on-device while ensuring traceability and reliability, setting a high bar for local-first AI applications.
