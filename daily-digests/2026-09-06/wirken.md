## Summary
Wirken is a secure, multi-channel agent orchestration framework that routes messages from platforms like Telegram, Discord, and Slack to AI agents while enforcing strict security, audit, and isolation controls. It operates as a single static Rust binary and integrates with major LLM providers and MCP servers.

## Key Features
- Per-channel process isolation with Ed25519 authentication over Unix domain sockets
- Tamper-evident, hash-chained audit logs with Ed25519 attestation for session integrity
- XChaCha20-Poly1305 encrypted credential vault with OS keychain integration and per-credential expiry
- Out-of-process MCP proxy for credential isolation and sandboxed tool execution
- Multi-tier permission system with capability-attenuated child agents and hard runtime limits

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Wirken provides enterprise-grade security and auditability for AI agent deployments, ensuring safe multi-channel interactions while preventing credential leaks and lateral movement in compromised environments.
