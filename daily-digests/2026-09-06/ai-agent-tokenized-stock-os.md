## Summary
A non-custodial MCP-based operating system enabling AI agents to discover, price, plan, and execute swaps for tokenized stocks on Robinhood Chain (4663). It integrates multi-venue liquidity (Uniswap, 0x RFQ, Chainlink), enforces agent guardrails, and supports Morpho Earn vaults for USDG deposits.

## Key Features
- Multi-venue liquidity aggregation (Uniswap, 0x RFQ, Chainlink) for tokenized stocks on Robinhood Chain (4663)
- Non-custodial executable swap plans with policy enforcement (allowlists, spend limits, simulate-first checks)
- Canonical registry of tokenized equities/ETFs and USDG/WETH pairs with Chainlink pricing
- Durable agent sessions with kill switches and policy management via `@aatos/policy`
- Integration with Morpho Earn for USDG deposits and Uniswap V3 for on-chain swaps

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides the critical infrastructure for AI agents to safely and correctly interact with tokenized stocks on-chain, bridging the gap between agentic trading and real-world asset (RWA) markets.
