## Summary
Editmamei is an MCP server that enables natural-language photo editing by orchestrating Adobe Photoshop through local automation. It acts as a bridge between AI assistants and Photoshop, allowing users to describe edits in plain language while Photoshop executes them non-destructively using its native tools.

## Key Features
- Acts as an MCP stdio server for AI client integration, enabling natural-language photo editing workflows.
- Drives Adobe Photoshop via native automation (COM on Windows, AppleScript on macOS) without generative AI touching pixels.
- Supports 87 tools across 16 capability groups, including AI-powered selections, adjustments, and on-device perception.
- Ensures non-destructive edits by default (adjustment layers, smart objects) and provides verification tools for accuracy.
- Offers both Community (free) and Pro (paid) editions with advanced features like Camera Raw, face mesh detection, and automation templates.

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It bridges the gap between AI assistants and professional photo editing tools, enabling precise, non-destructive edits through natural language while keeping all processing local and under user control.
