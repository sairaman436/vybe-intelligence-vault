## Summary
A Claude Skill designed for medical slide decks that verifies citations and numbers against PubMed and other databases, corrects errors, reorders slides for better flow, splits overloaded pages, and optionally rewrites dense text into plain language. It focuses on detecting 'real but distorted' errors common in medical presentations.

## Key Features
- Multi-step medical slide deck processing: verify, correct, reorder, split, and rewrite content.
- Focuses on detecting 'real but distorted' errors (e.g., misattributed citations, incorrect numbers, protocol vs. results).
- Integrates PubMed, Crossref, and publisher pages for fact-checking, avoiding AI-generated fabrications.
- Automatically tracks and upgrades citations from conference posters to peer-reviewed papers.
- Outputs a corrected, reordered, and split deck with plain-language options and a pending references list.

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It automates the critical but error-prone task of verifying medical slide content, ensuring accuracy and clarity for presentations while reducing the risk of misinformation in clinical or research contexts.
