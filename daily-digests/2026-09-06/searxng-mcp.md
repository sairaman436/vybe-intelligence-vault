## Summary
A token-efficient MCP server that integrates SearXNG metasearch with LLMs, enabling private web search, multi-query research, and page extraction while preserving full result payloads in hidden metadata for optimal token usage.

## Key Features
- Compact model-visible output with full payloads preserved in hidden `_meta` for token efficiency
- Parallel search and fetch operations for faster research workflows
- Rendered extraction for JavaScript-heavy pages with automatic Playwright Chromium setup
- Multiple transport options (stdio, streamable-http, SSE) for flexible deployment
- Self-hostable with Docker support and hardened production deployment options

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables private, token-efficient web search and page extraction for RAG pipelines by leveraging SearXNG while minimizing token waste on raw HTML.
