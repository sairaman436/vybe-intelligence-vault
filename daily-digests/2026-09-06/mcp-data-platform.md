## Summary
mcp-data-platform is an MCP server that bridges AI assistants to data infrastructure, enriching tool responses with business context from a semantic layer. It enables bidirectional cross-enrichment between Trino, DataHub, and S3, while providing persistent memory, governance workflows, and a web portal for AI-generated assets.

## Key Features
- Automatic enrichment of tool responses with business context (owners, deprecation, quality scores, PII flags)
- Bidirectional cross-enrichment between Trino, DataHub, and S3 for unified data access
- Persistent memory layer with hybrid semantic/lexical recall using pgvector
- Governance workflow for knowledge capture, review, and approval with rollback support
- Unified gateway for MCP servers, REST APIs, and AI-generated assets via a web portal

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It eliminates the need for AI assistants to make multiple round-trip calls to gather business context by enriching tool responses with semantic metadata, significantly improving accuracy and reducing token usage in RAG pipelines.
