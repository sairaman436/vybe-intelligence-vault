## Summary
LuLu is a production-grade AI operations platform for workforce management in labour-hire and mining-services businesses. It securely exposes ~61 governed tools over a bronze-silver-gold Parquet lake via a remote MCP gateway, enforcing a three-layer security chain (policy engine, SQL validator, output guard) to prevent free-form SQL and ensure role-based access control.

## Key Features
- Three-layer security chain (policy engine, SQL validator, output guard) enforcing role-based access and preventing free-form SQL
- Remote MCP gateway with Entra ID OAuth for secure client authentication and dynamic tool catalogues
- Governed writes and actions with dry-run, confirmation, and full audit trails
- Parallel data pipelines (Azure Blob + Microsoft Fabric) with daily parity gates and CI/CD synchronization
- RAG knowledge tool and capability registry for company automations and business rules indexing

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
LuLu demonstrates a production-hardened security model for AI agents, ensuring safe, governed access to internal systems without exposing raw data or allowing arbitrary queries.
