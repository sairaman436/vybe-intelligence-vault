## Summary
Omnifeed is a self-hosted web search and LLM-friendly crawling system that integrates SearXNG for search and crawl4ai for content extraction, with dedicated engines for Reddit, Hacker News, GitHub, and Discourse. It provides a full research loop for AI agents, returning structured, token-efficient content like TOON (a compact format for Reddit comment trees).

## Key Features
- Integrates SearXNG for multi-engine web search (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Reddit) with ranked URL results
- Dedicated Reddit engine returns full comment trees as TOON (~40% smaller than JSON, lossless) without requiring Reddit API keys
- Supports Hacker News, GitHub issues/PRs, and Discourse forums via direct API integration
- Provides MCP server and REST API for seamless integration with AI agents and clients like Open WebUI
- Token-efficient content extraction via crawl4ai with configurable size controls and fallback mechanisms

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Omnifeed streamlines the research loop for AI agents by combining search and content extraction into a single self-hosted service, enabling efficient, token-optimized data retrieval from diverse sources like Reddit and Hacker News without API key constraints.
