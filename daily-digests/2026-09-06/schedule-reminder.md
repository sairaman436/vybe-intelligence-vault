## Summary
A persistent, crash-safe SQLite-based schedule and reminder system that tracks todos, events, and progress with a state machine. It provides a stable CLI/JSON API for other skills to interact with and fires due reminders via Discord.

## Key Features
- Crash-safe SQLite storage with WAL mode for concurrency and durability
- Stable CLI/JSON API with versioned contract (api_version 1.0.0) for downstream skills
- State machine for tasks (pending/doing/done/blocked/cancelled) with progress tracking
- Idempotent writes, at-least-once delivery, and unknown field preservation
- Due reminder dispatch via Discord with missed-fire catch-up on next run

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a reliable, contract-first foundation for other AI skills to persistently track and manage tasks, events, and progress with built-in reminder capabilities.
