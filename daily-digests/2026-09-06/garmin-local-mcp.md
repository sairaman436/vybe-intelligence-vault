## Summary
A local-first MCP server for Garmin data that syncs once and enables offline analysis-grade queries. It stores immutable raw snapshots and a SQLite warehouse, providing compact, server-side computed responses for trends, correlations, and anomalies without relying on Garmin's API.

## Key Features
- Incremental sync into local raw JSON snapshots and SQLite warehouse for offline resilience
- Server-side analysis with compact columnar responses (typically <2 KB) for trends, correlations, and anomalies
- Zero-auth fallback via FIT file import for offline data ingestion
- 12 curated tools for composable queries (e.g., `correlate`, `baselines`, `anomalies`)
- Resumable sync with rate-limiting and data quality flags for sparse or provisional Garmin data

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables RAG builders to integrate Garmin health data with offline resilience and compact, analysis-ready responses, reducing API dependency and context flooding while preserving data ownership.
