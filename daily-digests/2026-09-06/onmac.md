## Summary
onmac is a policy engine and consent gate that enables AI agents to safely interact with a user's Mac filesystem and settings. It enforces strict offline operation, transaction-based rollbacks, and tamper-evident audit logs to ensure safety even when the AI model is compromised or misled.

## Key Features
- Offline-by-construction architecture with no network access, ensuring data never leaves the machine
- Strict policy engine with deny-by-default rules and path normalization to prevent privilege escalation
- Transaction-based rollback system with atomic writes and hardlink snapshots for instant reversibility
- Tamper-evident audit logging with hash-chained records to detect log tampering
- Multi-backend LLM support (MLX and llama.cpp) with unified policy enforcement

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a critical safety layer for AI agents interacting with local filesystems, enabling secure and reversible operations without exposing data to external networks.
