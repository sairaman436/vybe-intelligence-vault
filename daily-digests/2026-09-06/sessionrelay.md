## Summary
SessionRelay is a local-first memory layer for AI coding assistants that unifies and preserves conversation history across multiple AI tools (e.g., Claude Code, ZCode) in a project-level database. It enables cross-time, cross-tool, and cross-person memory retention with structured retrieval, MCP integration, and HOP handoff protocol for seamless team transitions.

## Key Features
- Unified project-level memory storage across multiple AI tools (Claude Code, ZCode, Codex, Qoder, Trae) with zero vendor lock-in.
- Structured retrieval with Chinese full-text search (jieba + FTS5), forced provenance tracking, and context-safe querying to prevent hallucinations.
- MCP Server with 15 tools (8 read + 7 write) enabling AI agents to query, annotate, and manage session memory dynamically.
- HOP handoff protocol (hop/1.0) for secure, integrity-verified team transitions with automatic sanitization and quarantine mechanisms.
- Passive capture via daemon (30s sync) to prevent data loss from AI context compression, with support for manual sync and historical backfill.

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
SessionRelay provides a critical infrastructure layer for RAG builders by ensuring complete, structured, and provenance-tracked memory retention across AI tools and teams, reducing hallucinations and enabling seamless project handoffs.
