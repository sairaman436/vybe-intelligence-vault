## Summary
An enterprise AI agent system built with LangGraph, combining a self-correcting Agentic RAG engine for document Q&A with a deterministic office-workflow agent that routes free-text requests to seven local capabilities. The design emphasizes engineering discipline, clear module boundaries, and CI-safe testing with optional LLM assists for synthesis tasks.

## Key Features
- Self-correcting Agentic RAG engine with CRAG-style workflow, quality gates, and bounded retries
- Deterministic office-workflow agent with seven capabilities (Knowledge Q&A, Email Summary, Calendar Lookup, Task/Ticket Assistant, Daily Briefing, Meeting Agent, Workflow/Approval Agent)
- Modular architecture with clear boundaries between RAG and office layers, avoiding duplication of logic
- Privacy-aware runtime modes (PRIVACY_MODE, OFFLINE_MODE) for controlled external service access
- Full CI-safe testing suite, FastAPI adapter, and React-based observability workspace

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
This repository provides a production-grade reference architecture for integrating Agentic RAG with deterministic workflow automation, offering critical insights into modular design, quality gates, and privacy-aware deployment patterns for RAG/AI stack builders.
