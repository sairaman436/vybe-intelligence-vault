## Summary
An embeddable, multi-tenant AI support and booking agent that answers queries strictly from a business's own documents with citations, a refusal gate, and human escalation. Runs entirely in the browser for demos and supports zero-API-key retrieval via BM25 over SQLite.

## Key Features
- Zero-API-key retrieval with BM25 over SQLite inverted index, including term-frequency saturation and document-length normalization
- Confidence gating system that prevents hallucinations by refusing to answer when coverage or strength is below threshold
- Embeddable widget with shadow DOM isolation for seamless integration into third-party websites
- Multi-tenant architecture with tenant-specific configuration (branding, hours, escalation, services) stored in JSON files
- Built-in analytics dashboard for content gaps, escalations, bookings, and retrieval inspection

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a production-ready, grounded RAG agent framework with built-in refusal gating and multi-tenancy, eliminating hallucinations while enabling 24/7 support and booking capture without external API dependencies.
