## Summary
A read-only breach-intelligence MCP server that aggregates public breach data from verified sources (HIBP, RansomLook, ransomwatch, SEC EDGAR) to report whether an organization has been breached, recent breach news, historical breach timelines, and threat text assessments—without exposing leaked records or sensitive data.

## Key Features
- Aggregates breach data from four primary public sources (HIBP, RansomLook, ransomwatch, SEC EDGAR) into a single queryable interface.
- Provides breach history, timelines, and statistics for organizations dating back to 2007, including repeat-victim assessments.
- Redacts sensitive data (emails, hashes, IPs, crypto addresses) from all responses, ensuring ethical and safe use in AI agents.
- Includes tools for assessing threat text, checking domain exposure, and monitoring feed freshness with staleness flags.
- Self-hostable, MIT-licensed, and deployable via pip with stdio or HTTP modes for MCP clients.

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a critical, ethical, and aggregated source of breach intelligence that AI agents can safely query to assess organizational exposure without handling leaked data.
