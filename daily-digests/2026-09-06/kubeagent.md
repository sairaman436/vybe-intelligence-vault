## Summary
kubeagent is a read-only Kubernetes troubleshooting CLI and daemon that diagnoses pod failures, identifies root causes, and provides actionable insights without modifying the cluster. It supports optional AI-driven explanations, agentic investigations, and integrates with CI/CD pipelines for automated health checks.

## Key Features
- Deterministic, offline diagnosis of pod failures (CrashLoopBackOff, OOMKilled, ImagePullBackOff, etc.)
- Optional AI-driven explanations via Claude API or agentic investigations for deeper root cause analysis
- CI/CD gate with SARIF output for automated health checks and pipeline integration
- MCP server for AI agent tool integration and Prometheus metrics for continuous monitoring
- Interactive TUI and shareable HTML reports for human-readable diagnostics

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
kubeagent provides critical, read-only Kubernetes diagnostics that help AI stack builders understand and resolve cluster issues without invasive operations, ensuring safer and more reliable RAG deployments.
