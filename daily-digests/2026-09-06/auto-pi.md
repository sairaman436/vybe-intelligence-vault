## Summary
auto-pi is a workflow orchestration system designed to enhance the Pi AI agent by providing structured, pinned workflows and bounded autonomy for task execution. It acts as a 'dress on Pi’s minimal harness' by integrating skills, prompts, and guardrails to ensure reliable and steerable AI-driven workflows.

## Key Features
- Pinned workflows with mechanical skill injection via `skill:` frontmatter for critical phases (e.g., `/plan`, `/build`, `/review`).
- Bounded autonomy with `/loop` extension, enforcing tool allowlists, contract preflight, RED/plateau exits, and commit-hash-based shipping.
- Model-agnostic design, compatible with any Pi-supported model (Claude, ChatGPT, GLM, etc.).
- Predefined prompts and chains (e.g., `/feature` for plan→build→review→ship) with steerable follow-ons.
- Observable system with `/trace-skills` for tracking activated vs. orphaned skills and `/handoff` for deterministic session summaries.

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a structured, reliable framework for AI agents to execute complex tasks with bounded autonomy, reducing hallucinations and ensuring procedural consistency in RAG pipelines.
