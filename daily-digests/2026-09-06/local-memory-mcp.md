## Summary
A local-first MCP server providing persistent memory for AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, and Codex. It stores learnings, decisions, and facts in a SQLite database with hybrid retrieval (BM25 + vector cosine via RRF), bi-temporal queries, and contradiction detection—all running entirely offline without API keys.

## Key Features
- Persistent local storage of AI learnings and facts in a single SQLite file with no cloud dependency
- Hybrid retrieval combining BM25 keyword search and vector cosine similarity via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)
- Bi-temporal 'asOf' queries to retrieve knowledge valid at a specific point in time
- LLM-free contradiction detection and fact supersession for managing stale or conflicting information
- Multilingual embeddings (100+ languages) with local model inference (Xenova/multilingual-e5-small)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables RAG systems to maintain persistent, context-aware memory without relying on external APIs or cloud services, ensuring privacy and reducing latency while improving relevance through hybrid retrieval and bi-temporal querying.
