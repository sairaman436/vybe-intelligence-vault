## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables agents to search, query, and analyze government open-data portals (Socrata SODA API) via tools, resources, and prompts. Supports STDIO and Streamable HTTP transports with optional DuckDB-powered analytical SQL for large datasets.

## Key Features
- Six MCP tools for full Socrata workflow: portal discovery, dataset search, schema inspection, SoQL querying, and DuckDB-powered analytical SQL over large result sets
- Discovery API integration with curated 40-portal catalog and live dataset counts (cached ~24h)
- DataCanvas spillover for large query results, enabling SQL analysis via DuckDB without additional setup
- Structured error handling, recovery hints, and agent-friendly output (e.g., assembled SoQL strings, column type context)
- Pluggable auth, storage backends, and transport types (stdio/HTTP) with Docker and npm installation support

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a standardized MCP interface to access and analyze government open datasets, enabling AI agents to integrate real-world data seamlessly into RAG workflows.
