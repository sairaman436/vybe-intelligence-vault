## Summary
ChannelTerm enables shared terminal sessions between humans and AI agents over a single hardware connection, allowing both to interact with the same serial device simultaneously. It acts as a bridge, exposing terminal sessions to CLI clients and MCP-compatible AI systems without replacing the human's terminal access.

## Key Features
- Shared serial terminal sessions for simultaneous human and AI access
- MCP-compatible interface for AI tool integration
- Independent output cursors to prevent data consumption conflicts
- Local escape commands for CLI control (e.g., detach, timestamps)
- Deterministic session references and TOML profile support

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
ChannelTerm enables seamless collaboration between humans and AI in hardware debugging workflows by sharing a single terminal session without disrupting the human's control or visibility.
