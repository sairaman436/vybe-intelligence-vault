## Summary
A source-available DNS and email security scanner implemented as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, providing 80+ tools for domain security analysis, remediation guidance, and compliance mapping via Streamable HTTP, stdio, or legacy HTTP+SSE transports.

## Key Features
- 80+ MCP tools covering SPF, DMARC, DKIM, DNSSEC, SSL/TLS, and more for comprehensive domain security analysis
- Guided remediation with `generate` tool producing provider-aware prioritized action plans and ready-to-publish records
- Supply chain mapping and attack path simulation for third-party dependency risk assessment
- Self-tuning scoring and per-tier analytics with Cloudflare Workers-based telemetry
- Passive and read-only operation using public DNS-over-HTTPS with no authorization required from targets

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides essential security scanning and remediation capabilities for RAG builders to validate and harden domain configurations, reducing attack surfaces and improving data integrity in AI-driven workflows.
