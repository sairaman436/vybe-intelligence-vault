## Summary
Hermeneutic is an evidence-first drift detection tool for AI agents that mines user corrections from chat logs to identify recurring interpretation failures and applies a fixed epistemic gate to outgoing AI responses to flag unverifiable claims before they are trusted or shipped.

## Key Features
- Mines correction episodes from AI chat logs (prompt → assistant → user correction → repair) to build a local corpus of user-specific interpretation failures.
- Applies a fixed, deterministic epistemic gate to outgoing AI responses, flagging unverifiable claims (e.g., completion with counts, universal quantifiers like 'all') before they are trusted.
- Optional retrieval layer uses embeddings to surface relevant prior corrections as advisory context for similar future tasks.
- Zero dependencies for the standalone gate, designed for offline use and script integration with exit codes for automation.
- Supports multiple AI log formats (Claude Code, Codex, OpenAI) and offers optional integrations (e.g., Claude Code hooks, Python Router for advanced composition).

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It prevents AI drift and unverifiable claims from propagating in production workflows by leveraging user corrections and enforcing evidence-based validation before responses are trusted.
