## Summary
mcpcap is a modular Python MCP (Model Context Protocol) server designed for analyzing PCAP files. It provides stateless, protocol-specific analysis tools for network protocols like DNS, DHCP, ICMP, TCP, and SIP, enabling seamless integration with MCP clients such as Claude Desktop.

## Key Features
- Stateless MCP tools with dynamic PCAP file or URL input for each analysis call
- Modular architecture supporting DNS, DHCP, ICMP, TCP, SIP, and CapInfos protocols
- Advanced TCP analysis including connection lifecycle, retransmissions, and flow inspection
- Support for both local file paths and remote HTTP/HTTPS URLs for PCAP files
- Structured JSON responses optimized for LLM consumption and integration

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
mcpcap enables AI-driven network analysis by providing structured, protocol-specific insights from PCAP files, making it essential for building RAG systems that require detailed network traffic understanding.
