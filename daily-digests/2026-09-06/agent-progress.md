## Summary
agent-progress provides tqdm-style progress bars in the Claude Code statusline for long-running jobs, automatically tracking and displaying progress without blocking the conversation. It uses a detached watcher to observe jobs and adjust ETAs dynamically, while minimizing token usage by only engaging when necessary.

## Key Features
- Automatic progress bar display in Claude Code statusline for long-running jobs
- Dynamic ETA correction based on real-time throughput measurements
- Minimal token usage by only engaging after a configurable threshold (default 20s)
- Supports multiple agents/sessions with job ownership isolation
- Crash reporting with detailed logs and automatic handover for missed reports

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enhances AI engineering workflows by providing real-time visibility into long-running jobs without disrupting the development process, reducing context-switching and improving productivity.
