## Summary
McpDiffusion is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes INSEE's public data sources to Large Language Models, enabling seamless integration with LLM clients via a single HTTP endpoint. It aggregates three distinct INSEE data sources—RMES, MELODI, and insee.fr—into unified tools for statistical analysis and concept definitions.

## Key Features
- Single MCP endpoint exposing INSEE publications, datasets, and concept definitions via FastMCP
- Supports three data sources: RMES (SPARQL), MELODI (REST/Elasticsearch), and insee.fr (HTTP scraping)
- Auto-registered tools with structured logging and per-tool call tracing
- Dockerized deployment with automated image publishing on GitHub
- Comprehensive LLM usage guide (SKILL.md) for tool selection and workflow patterns

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables LLMs to directly access and query authoritative French statistical data, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of AI-driven insights for users in France and beyond.
