## Summary
lintlang is a deterministic static linter designed to catch structural issues in AI agent configurations, tool descriptions, and system prompts before runtime. It uses 7 structural detectors (H1–H7) and 6 HERM scoring dimensions to flag vague tool descriptions, missing constraints, and schema mismatches without requiring LLM or network calls.

## Key Features
- Zero-LLM static analysis for AI agent configs and prompts
- 7 structural detectors (H1–H7) for common failure patterns
- Provider-neutral preflight mode for single-instruction validation
- Deterministic verdicts (PASS, REVIEW, FAIL, ERROR) with severity-based gating
- CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions and customizable fail conditions

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a critical pre-runtime quality gate for AI agent configurations and prompts, ensuring structural correctness and reducing runtime failures without incurring LLM or API costs.
