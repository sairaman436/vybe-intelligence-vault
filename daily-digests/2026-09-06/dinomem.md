## Summary
dinomem is a self-curating long-term memory system for AI agents that automatically distills, deduplicates, and reviews session data to maintain high-quality, noise-free memory. It uses LLM-driven extraction, semantic search, and git-versioned backups to ensure memories are accurate, reversible, and improve over time with model advancements.

## Key Features
- Automated session archiving and memory extraction using LLMs to distill key facts, decisions, and patterns into structured files.
- Git-versioned memory storage with isolated snapshots for reversible edits and backups (keep-3 rotation).
- Navigation index (MEMORY.md) injected into agent context to guide semantic search and recall.
- Memory pinning and note management with auto-deletion for resolved or stale items.
- Agent self-configuration for rules, scheduling, and automation with cost-tiered execution.

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
dinomem ensures AI agents retain high-quality, noise-free long-term memory that improves with model advancements, reducing the need for manual configuration and enabling reliable recall without context bloat.
