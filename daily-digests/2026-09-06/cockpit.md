## Summary
Cockpit is a customizable dashboard shell and chat organizer for the Hermes Agent framework, enabling users to organize chat sessions into folders and workspaces while providing a branded, calm UI. It operates as a separate SPA served via the Hermes dashboard without modifying the core Hermes backend.

## Key Features
- Organizes Hermes chat sessions into folders and workspaces (Inbox, Archive, custom folders) with persistent metadata storage
- Survives Hermes updates by operating as a separate SPA via HERMES_WEB_DIST environment variable
- Supports basic auth and LAN access with a calm, branded UI (byjtt.com theme)
- Stores folder metadata externally in HERMES_HOME/data/cockpit/*.json, avoiding interference with Hermes internals
- Pluggable themes and customizable default folders for rebranding and personalization

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Cockpit enhances Hermes Agent usability by providing structured session organization and a premium UI, making it easier for developers to manage and navigate agentic workflows.
