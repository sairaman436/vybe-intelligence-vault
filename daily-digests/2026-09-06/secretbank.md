## Summary
Secretbank is an open-core secrets manager that tracks API keys and their dependencies across projects, deployments, and URLs, enabling users to assess blast radius before revoking or rotating credentials. It combines zero-knowledge encryption with a dependency graph and incident feed for supply-chain risk management.

## Key Features
- Zero-knowledge vault with on-device encryption (age crate)
- Dependency graph mapping Issuer → Credential → Usage → Project → Deployment → URL
- Blast radius preview for credential revocation decisions
- Supply-chain risk detection via OSV.dev and NVD/GitHub Advisory matching
- Multi-device E2EE sync using Yjs CRDT and Cloudflare Workers relay

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides critical context for credential management in AI workflows by mapping dependencies and risks, reducing blind spots in secret rotation and supply-chain vulnerabilities.
