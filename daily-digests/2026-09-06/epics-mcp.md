## Summary
EPICS-MCP is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes EPICS control system data as tools for AI assistants, enabling natural language queries about live PV values, device connections, alarm configurations, and historical data without manual UI navigation.

## Key Features
- Exposes EPICS control system data as MCP tools for AI assistants
- Read-only by default with triple-gated write access for safety
- Supports multiple planes: live PVs, registry, history, alarms, naming, logbook, and displays
- Includes standalone CLI tools (epics-doctor, epics-diagnose, epics-crossplane) for diagnostics
- Configurable via environment variables for flexible deployment

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It bridges EPICS control systems with AI assistants, enabling natural language queries and automated diagnostics for operators and engineers.
