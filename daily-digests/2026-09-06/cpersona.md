## Summary
CPersona is an MCP memory server that provides persistent memory for AI agents like Claude by storing and retrieving context across sessions using a local SQLite database and hybrid search. It operates without LLM dependencies and offers 29 tools for memory management.

## Key Features
- Hybrid search combining vector, FTS5, and keyword retrieval for robust memory recall
- Zero LLM dependency with deterministic behavior and no hidden API costs
- Single SQLite file for portability and simplicity
- Confidence scoring with dynamic time decay and recall boost for relevance ranking
- Agent namespace isolation, background task queue, and memory protection features

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
CPersona enables AI agents to retain context and memory across sessions, significantly improving the coherence and personalization of interactions in RAG systems.
