## Summary
WorkUnit OS is an AI work operating system that ingests scattered work signals (Slack, GitHub, Calendar) and normalizes them into reviewable WorkUnit Nodes with a safety-first execution pipeline. It focuses on preview, approval, and dry-run verification without enabling real external execution in its current alpha release.

## Key Features
- Multi-source signal ingestion (Slack, GitHub, Calendar) with normalization into WorkUnit candidates
- Server-side approval pipeline with tenant isolation and SHA-256 hashing for security
- Dry-run execution verification without side effects or real external calls
- Execution readiness gating based on server-derived approval status and tenant flags
- Regression-tested alpha flow covering draft → preview → approval → dry-run verification

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a critical safety-first framework for AI agents to preview, approve, and verify work actions before execution, reducing risks in automated workflows.
