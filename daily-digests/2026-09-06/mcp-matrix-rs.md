## Summary
mcp-matrix-rs is an MCP server that transforms a WLED-driven RGB LED matrix into a programmable display for AI agents, enabling safe rendering of text, images, and animations via MCP tool calls while enforcing frame rate, power, and media constraints.

## Key Features
- MCP-compliant tooling for driving LED matrices with AI agents via standardized tool calls
- Fixed-rate frame playout with real-time feedback from WLED for accurate rendering
- Media normalization pipeline (PNG, GIF, video) with resource limits and deadlines
- Software power clamping to prevent hardware damage while maximizing brightness
- Modular Rust architecture with separate crates for frame rendering, media processing, and device communication

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a critical safety layer for AI agents to render arbitrary content on physical displays without risking hardware damage or violating performance constraints, bridging the gap between AI tool calls and real-world output.
