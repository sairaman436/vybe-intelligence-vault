## Summary
TreeLens provides a server-side mirror for live hierarchical data in applications like Photoshop, Figma, or Unity, enabling efficient diff-based synchronization between an LLM agent and the host application. It reduces context bloat and latency by syncing only changes rather than full tree snapshots.

## Key Features
- Diff-as-response mechanism to minimize payload size and latency
- In-memory mirror with atomic delta application and integrity hashing
- Query tools for navigation without round-trips to the host
- Drift recovery via integrity hash and push-listener for external edits
- Host-agnostic kernel with abstract adapter contract for extensibility

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
TreeLens solves the critical problem of context bloat in RAG systems by providing a lightweight, always-fresh view of large mutable hierarchies through diff-based synchronization.
