## Summary
A bridge that connects Claude Cowork (cloud sandbox) to a local Claude Code agent on your machine, enabling safe execution of tasks like builds, tests, and git operations. It uses a shared folder for communication, ensuring no open network ports or sudo access.

## Key Features
- Enables Claude Cowork to execute tasks on your local machine via a secure, file-based bridge
- Supports macOS, Linux, and WSL2 with systemd/launchd integration
- Idempotent task execution with caching to prevent duplicate runs
- No open network ports or sudo access required for security
- Supports MCP proxy for local stdio MCP servers (e.g., PostgreSQL, Filesystem)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It bridges the gap between cloud-based AI assistants and local execution, enabling secure, real-time task automation on your machine without exposing it to the internet.
