## Summary
A Rust-based MCP server and CLI for managing Tailscale tailnets via the Tailscale REST API. It provides read/write access to devices, routes, keys, policies, and users, with explicit safety gates for destructive operations.

## Key Features
- Exposes a single MCP tool (`tailscale`) for tailnet operations including listing devices, routes, keys, policies, and users
- Supports both MCP stdio and HTTP modes for local and shared deployments
- Implements explicit safety gates for destructive actions (e.g., device deletion requires confirmation and opt-in)
- Provides a CLI (`rtailscale`) for parity and debugging with JSON output
- Supports authentication via static bearer tokens, OAuth, or trusted gateways

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to programmatically manage Tailscale tailnets, automating device authorization and monitoring without exposing raw API keys to agents.
