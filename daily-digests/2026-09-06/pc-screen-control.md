## Summary
PC Screen Control is an MCP server for Windows that exposes the Windows accessibility tree to AI agents, enabling precise UI interactions by name rather than pixel coordinates. It provides structured data about on-screen elements, allowing AI to press the correct button, read tables, and verify actions without relying on screenshots.

## Key Features
- Exposes 34 tools for precise UI interactions (e.g., `invoke`, `read_table`, `find_elements`, `set_value`)
- Returns structured data about UI elements (names, states, automation IDs) for reliable AI operations
- Supports both local and remote MCP clients with one-click installation for Claude Desktop
- Implements safety mechanisms like input guards, burst actions, and visual warnings to prevent unintended disruptions
- Provides self-testing and error reporting to ensure system compatibility and reliability

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It transforms raw screen data into structured, actionable UI elements, enabling AI agents to interact with applications precisely and reliably without relying on error-prone pixel-based methods.
