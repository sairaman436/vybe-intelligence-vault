## Summary
vectors is an embedded Java library providing in-process vector search, durable local state, and metadata filtering for JVM applications. It eliminates the need for external vector databases by offering ANN indexes, quantizers, and mmap-based storage with Spring AI and LangChain4j integrations.

## Key Features
- Embedded vector search with durable local state and no external dependencies
- Supports multiple ANN indexes (HNSW, Vamana, IVF-Flat, IVF-PQ) and quantizers
- JDK Vector API for SIMD-accelerated distance kernels (4.4–6.8× faster than scalar)
- First-class integrations with Spring AI and LangChain4j for seamless adoption
- Atomic generation-based mmap persistence with metadata filtering and hybrid search

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a high-performance, embedded alternative to external vector databases for JVM applications, reducing operational overhead while maintaining advanced vector search capabilities critical for RAG pipelines.
