## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables search, query, and analysis of Eurostat statistical datasets (economy, demography, trade, health, NUTS regional data) via STDIO or HTTP. Provides 7 tools for dataset discovery, metadata retrieval, and data extraction with optional DuckDB-based dataframe canvas for SQL analytics.

## Key Features
- Search and browse 8,933+ Eurostat datasets with structured metadata and themes
- Query datasets with dimension filters, time ranges, and NUTS geo-level support
- Optional DuckDB dataframe canvas for SQL-based analytics on staged query results
- TTL-bounded in-memory cache for Eurostat catalogue with async-response detection
- Pluggable architecture with support for multiple storage backends and authentication methods

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Provides a standardized MCP interface to access and analyze Eurostat's vast statistical datasets, enabling AI agents to retrieve structured economic, demographic, and regional data for RAG applications.
