## Summary
Ultraprospect transforms geographic locations into defensible prospect lists by fusing OpenStreetMap data with French company register records, ensuring traceability and avoiding assumptions. It provides a zero-dependency CLI, agent skill, and MCP server for comprehensive company discovery and validation.

## Key Features
- Fuses OpenStreetMap and French company register data with strict identity matching to avoid false merges
- Refuses to make ambiguous assumptions (e.g., ambiguous locations, uncertain merges, or unverified contacts)
- Provides a zero-dependency, vendorable engine (`engine.mjs`) and CLI for reproducible prospecting
- Includes a gate system to validate data integrity before output (e.g., checks if contacts appear on fetched pages)
- Supports MCP server integration for programmatic access and orchestration across subagents

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Ultraprospect ensures prospect lists are traceable and defensible by rigorously validating and fusing geospatial and company data, eliminating guesswork that plagues traditional prospecting tools.
