## Summary
AURA is a dependency-free context optimizer for AI agents that reduces token usage by trimming unnecessary tools, compressing history, and distilling system prompts before API calls. It supports CLI, MCP server, and library modes, enabling deterministic pre-processing to minimize costs and improve efficiency.

## Key Features
- Tool injection optimization: Sends only relevant tools per turn, reducing token waste by up to 82% in benchmarks.
- History compression: Compacts stale conversation history to fit context budgets without dropping critical data.
- System prompt distillation: Removes redundant or bloated instructions while preserving core directives.
- Skill-based caching: Answers recurring prompts deterministically using cached responses or local computations.
- Zero-dependency design: Operates without external libraries, ensuring reliability and minimal overhead.

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
AURA directly reduces operational costs and latency for RAG/AI stacks by optimizing context before expensive API calls, ensuring only essential data is processed.
