## Summary
An MCP server that provides a shared coordination surface for multiple AI agents (Claude, Codex, Gemini) to manage handoffs, knowledge, and briefings across sessions, machines, or vendors. Acts as a team bus for solo operators and small teams running distributed agent workflows.

## Key Features
- Cross-agent handoffs with threading and commit-linkage for tracking work progress
- Shared knowledge base with hybrid search (FTS + pgvector embeddings)
- Daily/weekly briefings generation for team synchronization
- Cross-client safety controls with granular access policies
- Multi-transport support (stdio and HTTP) for distributed agent deployments

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables seamless coordination and knowledge sharing between disparate AI agents, reducing duplication and improving workflow continuity in distributed AI systems.
