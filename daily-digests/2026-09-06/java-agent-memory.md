## Summary
Java Agent Memory is an explainable, multi-level memory engine designed for Java AI agents, particularly within Spring applications. It provides a domain API for managing working, semantic, episodic, and procedural memories with support for both local and distributed storage backends like Redis and Milvus.

## Key Features
- Supports four memory types: working, semantic, episodic, and procedural with TTL semantics for working memory
- Explainable hybrid ranking with detailed score breakdowns (semantic, keyword, entity, recency, working memory boost)
- Zero-infrastructure local mode with seamless transition to Redis + Milvus for production
- Write strategies: APPEND_ONLY, RECONCILE, and DIRECT with auditable change events
- Scoped memory isolation by tenant, user, agent, and session

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a native Java/Spring solution for managing AI agent memory with transparent recall and lifecycle control, critical for building explainable and auditable RAG systems.
