## Summary
An MCP server that prevents indirect prompt injection attacks by tracking data provenance rather than text patterns. It taints content from untrusted sources and blocks side-effectful actions that trace back to tainted data, ensuring agents cannot be manipulated by malicious instructions embedded in fetched content.

## Key Features
- Tracks data provenance to detect indirect prompt injection attacks
- Blocks side-effectful actions (e.g., sending emails, writing files) that trace back to untrusted content
- Zero false positives in evaluation against six injection styles
- Lightweight and fast with no model calls or API keys required
- Provides detailed security logs and status for debugging and auditing

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a critical security layer for AI agents by preventing indirect prompt injection attacks through provenance tracking, ensuring agents cannot be manipulated by malicious instructions embedded in fetched content.
