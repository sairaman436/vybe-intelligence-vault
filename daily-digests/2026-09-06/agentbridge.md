## Summary
AgentBridge is a pay-per-fetch gateway enabling AI agents to access and parse Chinese web content (e.g., Xiaohongshu, Zhihu) that is otherwise difficult to scrape due to JavaScript rendering, anti-bot measures, or complex HTML. It converts dynamic web pages into clean, token-efficient Markdown and settles payments in USDC on Base via the x402 protocol.

## Key Features
- Pay-per-fetch pricing model settled in USDC on Base via x402 protocol
- JavaScript rendering support via Playwright for dynamic content
- Clean Markdown output from complex HTML structures
- Agent discovery endpoint (`/.well-known/agent.json`) for ReqCast integration
- No API keys or subscriptions required

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
AgentBridge solves the critical challenge of accessing and parsing Chinese web content for RAG systems, enabling AI agents to retrieve clean, structured data from otherwise inaccessible sources in a cost-effective and legally compliant manner.
