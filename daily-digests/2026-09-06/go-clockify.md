## Summary
A local, single-user Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Clockify that exposes time tracking, project management, invoicing, and reporting tools as callable functions for AI clients. It runs as a stdio subprocess with no account creation or service deployment required.

## Key Features
- Exposes 156+ Clockify tools (time entries, projects, invoices, reports) as MCP-compatible functions
- Local, single-user deployment with no service setup required (runs as stdio subprocess)
- Configurable toolset (default/core/business/admin/all) for tailored AI agent interactions
- Raw API fallback for unsupported endpoints with strict permission controls
- Built-in rate limiting, audit logging, and error recovery for robust AI agent integration

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to directly interact with Clockify's time tracking and project management features, streamlining workflow automation for productivity and billing tasks.
