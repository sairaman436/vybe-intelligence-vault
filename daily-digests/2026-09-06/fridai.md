## Summary
fridai is a lightweight MCP server that enables AI coding agents to recall past code, commits, and AI conversations locally without requiring an LLM. It indexes and searches agent interactions and codebases using local embeddings and lexical search.

## Key Features
- Local embeddings with FastEmbed/ONNX for semantic search without external APIs
- Multi-agent history indexing (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI)
- Incremental indexing with support for real-time updates via `--watch`
- Privacy-focused design with automatic secret redaction and local-only storage
- Hybrid search combining lexical (BM25) and vector (RRF) results with reranking

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
fridai enables AI coding agents to recall and reference past work artifacts locally, improving context-awareness and reducing reliance on external memory systems for RAG pipelines.
