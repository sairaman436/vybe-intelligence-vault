## Summary
Victor is a disciplined AI day-trading execution agent for Hong Kong and US equities, designed to analyze market data, compute trading signals, and emit structured buy/sell/stop recommendations while leaving execution to a human trader. It operates in 'signal mode' with strict guardrails and fact-verification rules.

## Key Features
- Emits structured trading signals (open/close/trailing stop/take-profit) with computed stop prices and expected value (EV) validation
- Strict guardrails: one ticker at a time, EV ≥ 0, no derivatives, flat by end of day, and mandatory stop prices
- Multi-source market data integration (Futu OpenD for HK/US, Tiger Brokers for HK backup)
- Fact-verification pipeline before emitting any signal (entity identity, arithmetic, trading calendar, fees)
- Human-in-the-loop execution model with automated signal logging and review

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Victor provides a rigorous framework for AI-driven trading signal generation with strict discipline and fact-checking, reducing execution risks for RAG builders integrating trading capabilities.
