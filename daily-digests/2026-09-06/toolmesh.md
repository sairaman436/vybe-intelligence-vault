## Summary
ToolMesh is a self-hosted MCP gateway that enables AI agents to safely interact with enterprise systems by providing a governed, auditable control layer. It replaces unwieldy MCP server wrappers with declarative YAML (DADL) files and enforces credential security, fine-grained authorization, input/output gating, and comprehensive audit logging.

## Key Features
- Declarative API description via DADL YAML files (30 lines replace full MCP servers)
- Fine-grained authorization with OpenFGA (user → plan → tool control)
- Runtime credential injection (secrets never exposed in prompts or configs)
- Input/output gating with JavaScript policies (PII redaction, confidential data blocking)
- Structured audit trail with SQLite and structured logging (slog)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
ToolMesh provides the critical governance and security layer that enables safe, auditable AI agent interactions with enterprise systems, bridging the gap between unconstrained tool calls and production-ready deployments.
