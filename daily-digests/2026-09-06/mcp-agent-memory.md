## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that bridges agent memory management to MCP-compatible clients like Kiro, Claude Desktop, and Cursor. It enables agents to read, append, and search memory files while optionally leveraging a background daemon for consolidation and extraction of durable memories.

## Key Features
- Exposes agent memory operations (read, append, search) via MCP for seamless integration with clients like Kiro, Claude Desktop, and Cursor
- Optional background daemon for automatic consolidation and extraction of durable memories from session summaries
- Supports multiple LLM backends (Bedrock, OpenAI, Kiro) with token-efficient configurations
- Interactive setup and configuration wizards for quick deployment and client registration
- Lightweight filesystem-based contract between MCP server and daemon, ensuring reliability and simplicity

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a standardized way for RAG systems to persistently store, retrieve, and consolidate agent memories, reducing redundant context and improving long-term reasoning capabilities.
