## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that queries multiple AI model families in parallel for the same question, returning unmerged, independent perspectives without synthesis or ranking. Inspired by the medieval Bayt al-Hikma, it enables diverse model viewpoints for critical decision-making.

## Key Features
- Parallel querying of multiple AI model families (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, local Ollama, etc.) for the same question
- Three operational modes: scribe (no tools), translator (read-only with strict scope), and scholar (read-only with flexible exploration)
- Returns unmerged, independent perspectives from each model for orchestrator weighing
- Supports read-only filesystem access in translator/scholar modes to analyze codebases
- Configurable model roster with budget controls for tool iterations and concurrency

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables RAG builders to gather diverse, unfiltered model perspectives on critical queries, reducing bias and improving decision-making by leveraging multiple AI model families simultaneously.
