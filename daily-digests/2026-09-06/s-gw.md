## Summary
s-gw is a local credential control system for coding agents that enables secure approval of bounded actions without exposing raw credentials. It acts as a gateway between agents and credential stores, injecting secrets only into approved child processes and returning sanitized output.

## Key Features
- Converts raw credentials into typed handles for safe agent reference
- Local approval workflow for scoped credential access
- Injects secrets only into approved child processes on the same machine
- Output sanitization to prevent raw secret exposure to agents
- Multi-platform support (macOS, Windows, Linux) with native UI and CLI

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
s-gw is essential for RAG/AI stack builders because it mitigates the risk of credential leakage to AI agents while enabling secure, controlled access to sensitive resources.
