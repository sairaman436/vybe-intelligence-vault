## Summary
VectorBench is a benchmarking framework for FAISS vector indexes that dissects embedding, indexing, and retrieval into inspectable components. It enables direct comparison of Flat, IVF, HNSW, and PQ indexes on recall@k, latency, and memory, while supporting hybrid BM25 + vector retrieval with metadata filtering.

## Key Features
- Direct FAISS index integration (IVF, HNSW, PQ, Flat) for transparent performance measurement
- Hybrid retrieval combining BM25 and vector search with reciprocal rank fusion
- Metadata filtering support for advanced retrieval scenarios
- Built-in benchmarking harness for recall@k, latency, and memory metrics
- Dataset download, chunking, and embedding utilities for end-to-end evaluation

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
VectorBench provides critical insights into the tradeoffs of different vector indexing strategies, enabling RAG builders to optimize retrieval performance and cost for their specific use cases.
