## Summary
Konnect is a KiCAD 10 plugin that enables AI-assisted PCB design through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It provides a single Rust binary exposing 179 tools for schematic capture, PCB layout, design validation, and manufacturing exports, allowing LLMs like Claude to interactively design and modify PCBs.

## Key Features
- Direct KiCAD 10 IPC API integration for real-time PCB edits with undo/redo support
- 179 tools across 18 toolsets for schematic capture, PCB layout, routing, and manufacturing exports
- Atomic S-expression editing for `.kicad_sch` files to prevent corruption
- Built-in JLCPCB part search and reference circuit templates for rapid prototyping
- Single static binary (~5 MB) with no external dependencies, reducing installation complexity

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Konnect streamlines AI-driven PCB design by eliminating multi-language dependencies and providing a robust, production-ready interface to KiCAD, making it essential for hardware engineers integrating LLMs into their workflows.
