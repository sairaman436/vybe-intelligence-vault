## Summary
Last EHR is an open-source agent layer that adds human-approved AI writeback to FHIR-based applications. It acts as a boundary between AI agents and FHIR backends (e.g., Medplum, HAPI FHIR), enabling agents to propose clinical writes that are only persisted after explicit user approval.

## Key Features
- Human-in-the-loop approval for AI-generated clinical writes to ensure safety and accuracy
- Read-only MCP server for bounded FHIR chart access (search_patients, show_patient_info)
- Multi-backend support (Medplum, HAPI FHIR, Firely Server, Aidbox) for synthetic and real-world evaluation
- Zero-key local synthetic demo for immediate evaluation without credentials or model keys
- Modular adapter system for extending support to additional FHIR backends

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a critical safety layer for AI agents interacting with clinical data, ensuring writes are human-approved before persistence, which is essential for RAG/AI stack builders in healthcare.
