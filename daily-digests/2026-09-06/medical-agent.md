## Summary
A Russian-language LLM agent that coordinates medical document retrieval, drug interaction checks, mock pharmacy inventory lookups, and structured escalation for medical queries. It implements a hand-written function-calling loop with deterministic input guards and trace-aware evaluation for safety and reliability.

## Key Features
- Hand-written function-calling loop with no external agent framework for full control flow visibility
- Deterministic input guards for pediatric dosing, emergency symptoms, and self-harm intent before any model call
- Trace-aware LLM judge for groundedness verification and unsupported claim detection
- Integration with medical-rag for document retrieval and drug interaction checks via HTTP
- Structured escalation mechanism with machine-readable outcomes and rate limiting

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It demonstrates a production-grade, safety-first approach to building LLM agents for high-stakes domains like healthcare, emphasizing deterministic controls and traceable evaluation.
