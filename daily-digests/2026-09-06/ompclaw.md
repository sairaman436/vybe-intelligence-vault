## Summary
OmpClaw is a Bun-based package that provides authenticated remote access to persistent Oh My Pi (OMP) sessions via Telegram and WebSocket transports. It acts as a secure gateway, isolating credentials and managing state for operators needing remote OMP workspace control.

## Key Features
- Single RPC process managing persistent OMP sessions with serialized state
- Dual transport support: Telegram long polling and authenticated WebSocket
- SQLite-backed state management for principals, sessions, and bindings
- Transactional self-update with automatic rollback and post-update activation
- Optional per-topic OMP sessions and unattended automation with cron scheduling

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a secure, credential-isolated gateway for remote operators to interact with persistent OMP sessions without exposing transport credentials or direct process access.
