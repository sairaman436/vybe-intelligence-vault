## Summary
A minimal MCP (Model Context Protocol) server template for Cloudflare Workers, implementing a hand-rolled Streamable HTTP transport with zero runtime dependencies. Designed for tools-only servers, it simplifies deployment and reduces complexity while adhering to the MCP specification.

## Key Features
- Hand-rolled Streamable HTTP transport (~190 lines of code) for MCP servers
- Zero runtime dependencies, reducing bundle size and security surface
- Stateless design with single static bearer token authentication
- Simple tool registration via a single file (`src/tools.ts`)
- Supports JSON-RPC batches and protocol version negotiation

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a lightweight, dependency-free foundation for building MCP servers on Cloudflare Workers, ideal for developers seeking minimal overhead and maximum control over their AI tooling stack.
