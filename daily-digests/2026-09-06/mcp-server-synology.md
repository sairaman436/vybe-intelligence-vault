## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Synology NAS devices that enables AI assistants (e.g., Claude, Cursor) to manage files, downloads, and system operations via secure API integration. Supports both local and remote deployments with Docker and HTTP/SSE transport options.

## Key Features
- Enables AI assistants to interact with Synology NAS via MCP for file operations, download management, and system monitoring
- Supports both local (stdio) and remote (HTTP/SSE) deployments with Docker and reverse proxy configurations
- Provides comprehensive toolset including authentication, file system operations, Download Station management, and Container Manager integration
- Features auto-login, session recovery, and multi-client support (Claude/Cursor/Xiaozhi) with unified architecture
- Includes health monitoring tools for system metrics, disk health, and service status

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It bridges Synology NAS capabilities directly into AI workflows, enabling seamless file and system management for RAG pipelines and AI agents.
