## Summary
Demesne is an agent-agnostic MCP server that orchestrates untrusted shell scripts, AI coding agents, and research tasks within disposable, containerized sandboxes. It decouples agent reasoning from execution effects while enforcing security boundaries via read-only mounts and egress allowlists.

## Key Features
- Runs untrusted shell scripts, AI agents, and research tasks in disposable containers with strict security boundaries
- Supports persistent and one-off sandboxes with read-only host mounts and configurable egress allowlists
- Provides tools for script execution, file upload/download, agent delegation, and long-running research with internet access
- Enables multi-agent orchestration with nested sandboxes and job control (background, status, wait, cancel)
- Includes pre-built container images for media conversion, React rendering, Twine playtesting, and web game development

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Demesne enables secure, containerized execution of AI agents and scripts, reducing security risks while allowing autonomous task delegation for RAG and AI stack builders.
