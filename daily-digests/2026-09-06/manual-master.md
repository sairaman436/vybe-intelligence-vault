## Summary
A CLI-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tool that transforms local documents into an interactive knowledge base. It ingests files or directories, stores embeddings in ChromaDB, and powers a ReAct agent for source-backed answers with persistent caching.

## Key Features
- Recursive directory scanning for multi-format document ingestion (PDF, HTML, XML, TXT)
- Content-based caching using file headers, sizes, and tails for persistent embeddings
- Persistent vector storage with ChromaDB for instant reloading of indexed data
- ReAct agent with source citation for accurate, traceable responses
- Highly configurable via environment variables for chunking, models, and system prompts

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a turnkey solution for building and querying local RAG knowledge bases with persistent caching and source-backed AI responses.
