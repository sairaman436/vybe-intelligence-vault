## Summary
A lightweight orchestration tool for unattended Gmail inbox triage that classifies, alerts, archives, drafts replies, and summarizes emails without auto-sending or exposing raw mail data. It integrates with existing local tools like IMAP, Discord, and a task scheduler for seamless inbox management.

## Key Features
- Incremental IMAP monitoring with UID watermarking for efficiency
- Three-tier classification (rules, cheap scoring, LLM) to prioritize emails
- Drafts ASCII replies for user review without auto-sending
- Discord alerts with redacted one-line gists (no raw body exposure)
- Daily summary generation and integration with local task schedulers

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a secure, local-first approach to automating email triage with LLM-assisted classification while preserving user control over replies and data privacy.
