## Summary
A minimal, security-first MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables direct read/write access to the local filesystem via stdio transport for Claude Desktop, eliminating manual file handling workflows.

## Key Features
- 7 filesystem tools (write_file, read_file, list_directory, check_allowed, read_binary, write_binary, str_replace) for comprehensive file operations
- Path sandboxing with allowlist-based access control to restrict operations to predefined directories
- Zero network exposure with stdio-only transport, ensuring no open ports or HTTP servers
- Minimal footprint (under 30MB RAM at idle) and sub-500ms startup time for efficient operation
- Automatic directory creation and binary-safe file handling with base64 encoding for non-text files

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
This tool eliminates manual file handling friction in AI workflows by enabling direct filesystem access from Claude Desktop, making it essential for developers building automated AI-driven file operations.
