## Summary
A lightweight MCP server that bridges Simplenote with Claude Desktop, enabling seamless note management, search, and encryption for AI-driven workflows. It acts as a memory backend or content source for MCP-compatible clients.

## Key Features
- Full note lifecycle management (CRUD) with Simplenote via MCP
- Client-side AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive notes (Simplenote has no encryption at rest)
- Advanced search with Boolean operators, phrase matching, and tag/date filters
- High-performance in-memory caching with background synchronization
- Docker and Kubernetes-ready deployments with security hardening

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables secure, encrypted note management and retrieval for RAG pipelines, acting as a reliable memory backend for AI agents interacting with Simplenote.
