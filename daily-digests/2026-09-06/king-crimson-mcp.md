## Summary
A specialized MCP server that integrates MusicBrainz, Discogs, Cover Art Archive, and setlist.fm to provide King Crimson's discography and live-performance data, featuring a curated line-up era model and reverse lookup for live releases by song and incarnation.

## Key Features
- Cross-source integration layer for MusicBrainz, Discogs, Cover Art Archive, and setlist.fm using MBID for unified data retrieval.
- Curated line-up era model with eight distinct incarnations, enabling era-specific song performance history.
- Offline-first concert cache for instant, rate-limit-resistant queries after initial setup.
- Reverse lookup for songs to official live releases, grouped by incarnation, with transparent coverage reporting.
- Local caching of setlists and live releases to avoid repeated API calls and ensure data consistency.

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a specialized, high-fidelity data integration layer for music discographies and live performances, enabling precise era-based analysis and reverse lookups that generic tools cannot achieve.
