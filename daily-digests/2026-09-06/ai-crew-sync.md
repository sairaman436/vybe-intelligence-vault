## Summary
A Rust-based MCP server that acts as a coordination bus for AI coding agents (e.g., Claude Code, Codex, Cursor) to collaborate via a shared Postgres-backed state. It enables messaging, task coordination with dependencies, real-time updates, agent-to-agent RPC, and shared team memory.

## Key Features
- Multi-agent task coordination with lease-based TTL and dependency tracking
- Real-time updates via Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY for blocking waits
- Agent-to-agent RPC with direct messaging and file attachments
- Multi-team isolation with hashed token-based identity
- Horizontal scalability via stateless MCP Streamable HTTP transport

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a centralized, scalable coordination layer for AI agents to collaborate on tasks, share context, and manage dependencies in real-time, reducing coordination overhead in multi-agent workflows.
