## Summary
A Telegram bot that provides long-term semantic memory for users by storing and retrieving messages in Pinecone. It uses OpenAI for embeddings and chat completion, enabling context-aware conversations without external document pipelines.

## Key Features
- Persistent user message storage in Pinecone with per-user isolation via metadata filtering
- Semantic recall of past messages using vector search before generating replies
- Duplicate message control via cosine similarity threshold (0.85) to avoid redundant storage
- First-message greeting and nickname handling for personalized interactions
- Flexible configuration for standard or integrated Pinecone modes and OpenAI models

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a lightweight, production-ready framework for building AI assistants with built-in long-term memory using vector databases, reducing the need for external RAG pipelines.
