## Summary
LLMQore is a Qt/C++ library designed to simplify interactions with LLM providers and MCP servers. It provides unified APIs for LLM clients, MCP server/client implementations, and tools like the MCP Bridge for aggregating and re-exposing MCP servers.

## Key Features
- Unified streaming API for multiple LLM providers (Claude, OpenAI, Ollama, etc.)
- Full MCP server and client implementation with stdio and HTTP transports
- MCP Bridge for aggregating and re-exposing MCP servers behind a single endpoint
- ACP support for driving external coding agents (Claude Code, etc.)
- Prebuilt binaries for cross-platform deployment (Linux, macOS, Windows)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
LLMQore simplifies the integration of LLM providers and MCP servers into applications, reducing boilerplate and enabling seamless agent orchestration for RAG pipelines.
