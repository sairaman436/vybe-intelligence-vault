## Summary
A local Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for controlling an EDIFIER Halo PixelBar on Windows, enabling AI-driven adjustments to ambient lighting, pixel screen, and speaker volume via a strict allowlist of validated hardware interactions.

## Key Features
- Exposes a strict allowlist of tools for ambient light, pixel screen, and speaker volume control
- Validates hardware compatibility (VID, PID, interface, usage page) before enabling interactions
- Supports UTF-8 text display, color themes, and built-in scenes for the pixel screen
- Includes safety boundaries to prevent arbitrary HID packet writes or firmware access
- Designed for local MCP hosts like Codex or Claude Desktop with stdio server support

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI systems to directly control physical hardware like the EDIFIER Halo PixelBar, bridging AI decision-making with real-world ambient and visual feedback.
