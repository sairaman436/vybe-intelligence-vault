## Summary
Agent CI is a local GitHub Actions emulator that runs workflows entirely on your machine, replacing the cloud API with a full local emulation layer. It enables pre-flight checks, instant caching (~0ms), and pause-on-failure debugging before committing or pushing code.

## Key Features
- Full local emulation of GitHub Actions API using the official runner binary
- Instant caching via bind-mounts (~0ms) instead of network round-trips
- Pause on failure with container state preservation for interactive debugging
- Supports unmodified workflows and actions like `actions/checkout` and `actions/cache`
- Parallel job execution with optional prewarming for dependency installs

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents and developers to catch and fix CI failures instantly on their local machines before pushing, reducing remote CI debugging cycles and accelerating iteration speed.
