## Summary
A Pi extension that simulates the Cindy Desktop controlled endpoint (device-link sync), enabling the Cindy mobile app to browse and operate Pi sessions. It bridges Pi sessions with the Cindy mobile client via a device-link protocol.

## Key Features
- Session synchronization between Pi and Cindy mobile app via SQLite storage
- Bidirectional messaging with 16-channel input queue and projection backflow
- Session routing for multi-Pi processes sharing the same account (1-2s handoff)
- PKCE-based OAuth login with AES-256-GCM token encryption
- Endpoint hot updates via CDN manifest overrides

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables seamless control of Pi AI sessions from the Cindy mobile app, bridging desktop-like functionality to mobile users for enhanced AI agent interaction.
