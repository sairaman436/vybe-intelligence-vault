## Summary
BioStreamer is a hybrid structured/unstructured data platform designed to scale anaerobic digestion research by automating telemetry logging and reasoning over bioreactor data. It combines mechanistic simulation, SQL-based warehousing, and vector retrieval to provide attributed, literature-grounded answers for reactor performance analysis.

## Key Features
- Hybrid retrieval combining SQL aggregates with vector-based literature search for grounded answers
- Automated mechanistic simulation of 100 parallel bioreactors with peer-reviewed validation gates
- Airflow-orchestrated pipelines enforcing scientific reproducibility before data ingestion
- Streamlit UI for fleet overview, reactor explorer, and research chat with exposed retrieval traces
- Degrades gracefully without LLM access, returning raw retrieval context instead of failing

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It demonstrates a production-grade hybrid RAG system where SQL handles quantitative analysis and vectors handle mechanistic explanations, all validated against peer-reviewed science, making it a blueprint for trustworthy AI in quantitative domains.
