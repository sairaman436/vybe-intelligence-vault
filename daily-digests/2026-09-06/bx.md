## Summary
bx is a lightweight CLI tool that fetches, caches, and executes native binary MCP servers directly from GitHub releases without requiring Node.js or Python runtimes. It simplifies running compiled tools by handling platform-specific asset resolution, verification, and sandboxed execution.

## Key Features
- Fetches and caches binaries from GitHub releases with platform-specific asset resolution
- Supports pinned versions, tags, and named binaries via a simple spec syntax
- Enforces SHA-256 checksum verification for downloaded assets
- Provides opt-in sandboxing with platform-native isolation (macOS Seatbelt, Linux Bubblewrap, Windows AppContainer)
- Integrates with `.bx.toml` for dependency management and manifest tracking

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
bx eliminates runtime dependencies for running compiled MCP servers, enabling seamless integration of native tools into AI stacks while providing critical sandboxing for security.
