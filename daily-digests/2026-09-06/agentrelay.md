## Summary
AgentRelay is a local supervisor for AI coding agents (e.g., Claude Code) designed to run unattended overnight while enforcing strict guardrails. It blocks forbidden tool calls, validates completion via real test suites, checkpoints work to git for easy undo, caps spending, and generates a sourced morning report to distinguish evidence from guesses.

## Key Features
- PreToolUse hook to block forbidden tool calls before execution
- Evidence-gated 'done' validation using real test suites (e.g., npm test, cargo test)
- Undoable git checkpoints that commit only the agent's work, preserving user edits
- Spending budget kill-switch checked before each agent turn
- Sourced morning reports with tags (VERIFIED/RECORDED/ESTIMATED) for auditability

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
AgentRelay ensures AI coding agents operate deterministically and safely overnight by enforcing guardrails, validation, and auditability, reducing the risk of costly or irreversible errors in autonomous workflows.
