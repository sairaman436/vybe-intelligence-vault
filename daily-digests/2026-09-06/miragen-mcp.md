## Summary
miragen-mcp is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server designed to manage Miragen autonomous agents by exposing agent lifecycle, tooling, and filesystem operations as MCP tools. It orchestrates agents running in Docker containers, enabling AI clients like Claude to create, configure, and control agents in real time.

## Key Features
- Agent lifecycle management (create, start, stop, restart, delete) via Docker containers
- Tool management with AST-based parsing for registering, editing, and deleting tools in agent workspaces
- Filesystem access with path traversal protection for reading, writing, and editing files
- Scheduling prompts with delay or absolute time (ISO 8601) for agent interactions
- OAuth2 authentication and input guardrails for secure operations

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a critical orchestration layer for managing autonomous AI agents in Docker, enabling seamless integration with MCP-compatible clients for real-time agent control and tooling.
