## Summary
StatCite provides a free remote MCP server and REST API that delivers official economic statistics with full citations, enabling AI agents to cite sources accurately. It includes a verification tool to validate claimed figures against official data with detailed diagnostics.

## Key Features
- Provides official economic statistics (World Bank, IMF, ECB) with full citations including source, dataset, series ID, and license
- Includes `verify_stat` tool to validate claimed figures against official series with verdicts (match/close/mismatch/cannot_verify)
- Offers both MCP server and REST API endpoints for seamless integration with AI agents and applications
- Transparent fallback mechanisms for data sources with clear disclosure of vintage and limitations
- Pre-registered AI-accuracy benchmark (COVENANT.md) for evaluating verification performance

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
StatCite ensures AI agents can cite official economic data accurately and verify claims, reducing hallucinations and improving reliability in financial and economic applications.
