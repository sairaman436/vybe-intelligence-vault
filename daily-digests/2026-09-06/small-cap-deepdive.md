## Summary
A Claude Code skill that mechanically de-risk the SEC small-cap universe for a given investment theme or ticker by eliminating landmines (e.g., going-concern candidates, death-spiral diluters) and performing disciplined due diligence with forced disconfirmation. Outputs a ranked list of survivors requiring human diligence, not automated buy recommendations.

## Key Features
- Automated enumeration of SEC-filing small-cap universe for a theme or ticker using EDGAR full-text search and SIC reverse-recall
- Two-stage precision gating: coarse SIC exclusion followed by LLM-based business description classification (pure_play/partial/misrecall)
- Mechanical de-risking with hard kill-flags (going-concern, death-spiral convertibles, ICFR weaknesses, concentration risks)
- Disciplined deep-dive due diligence with forced disconfirmation, tiered evidence validation (T1-T3), and base-rate priors
- Deterministic reporting with funnel metrics, kill-flag eliminations, and track-forward calibration against distressed outcomes

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a systematic, reproducible framework to eliminate high-risk small-cap investments before human analysis, reducing downside exposure and improving risk-adjusted returns for RAG/AI stack builders focusing on fundamental data.
