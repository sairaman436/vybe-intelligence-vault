## Summary
Verified Executable Search (VES) is a verifier-first runtime for independently evaluating and grading AI-generated executable solutions. It enforces a strict trust boundary where the host recomputes facts, ensuring generated code cannot self-report metrics or bypass verification.

## Key Features
- Separates creation and judgment authority to prevent self-reporting bias in AI-generated code
- Provides a reusable, auditable verification runtime for executable artifacts
- Enforces strict artifact safety checks (path traversal, symlinks, size, UTF-8 validity)
- Supports deterministic verification replay for reproducibility
- Offers a modular search engine for iterative improvement of solutions

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
VES ensures AI-generated executable solutions are evaluated objectively and safely, preventing misreporting and enabling reliable, auditable workflows for RAG and agentic systems.
