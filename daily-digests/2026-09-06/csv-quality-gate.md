## Summary
csv-quality-gate is a command-line tool that performs preflight validation on CSV files, ensuring data integrity before pipeline ingestion. It checks for missing columns, empty cells, duplicates, and suspicious patterns, returning pass, warn, or fail status with appropriate exit codes.

## Key Features
- Preflight CSV validation to catch issues before pipeline runs
- Built-in profiles (generic, outreach) with configurable thresholds
- Pass/warn/fail exit codes for seamless CI/CD integration
- Supports both text and JSON output modes
- Zero runtime dependencies (stdlib-only)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It prevents costly pipeline failures by validating CSV data integrity upfront, ensuring only clean data proceeds to downstream AI or ETL processes.
