## Summary
Kolkrabbi is an open-source, model-agnostic AI coding agent CLI that supports chat, code, and agent modes. It enables users to interact with any AI model via OpenRouter, local endpoints (Ollama/vLLM), or direct subscriptions, while providing a local dashboard for tracking model performance, costs, and ratings.

## Key Features
- Three operational modes: chat (tool-free), code (Claude-Code style), and agent (task orchestration with dependencies)
- Effort dial for dynamic model tier selection and resource allocation (low/medium/high/max)
- 100% local cost and performance dashboard with JSONL-based stats tracking and manual ratings
- Checkpointing and undo functionality for file edits and conversation history
- Permission tiers (ask/auto-approve/full-auto) for controlled model interactions

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Kolkrabbi provides a lightweight, model-agnostic framework for AI-driven coding tasks with built-in cost tracking and performance analytics, making it ideal for RAG builders seeking a flexible, local-first agent system.
