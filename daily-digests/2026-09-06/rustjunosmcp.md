## Summary
A Rust-based Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Juniper Junos devices, offering async NETCONF/SSH management with advanced features like session pooling, confirmed commits, file transfers, and SRX-specific tooling. It is designed for sovereign network-security automation and interoperates with Juniper's official junos-mcp-server inventory format.

## Key Features
- Async Rust-based MCP server with NETCONF/SSH session pooling for high-performance Junos device management
- Advanced safety tools: confirmed commits with auto-rollback, commit validation without activation, and candidate discard
- File transfer capabilities: SCP-based upload/download with SHA-256 verification and disk space checks
- SRX-specific tooling: signature package lifecycle management, chassis-cluster health validation, and JTAC support bundles
- Blocklist guardrails for command and PFE command restrictions, with per-device and default rule sets

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
This MCP server provides a high-performance, Rust-native alternative for managing Juniper Junos devices with advanced safety and automation features critical for RAG/AI stack builders integrating network infrastructure.
