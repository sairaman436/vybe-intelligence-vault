## Summary
A controlled enterprise decision agent that integrates LangGraph orchestration, hybrid RAG, and MCP/MySQL under explicit evidence, citation, security, and release boundaries. It handles enterprise knowledge questions, read-only operational analysis, and mixed decision scenarios with fail-closed security and audit mechanisms.

## Key Features
- Controlled orchestration with explicit workflow stages (Router, Planner, Skill, Evidence, Reviewer, Release)
- Hybrid RAG combining dense retrieval, BM25, RRF fusion, and cross-encoder reranking for improved retrieval accuracy
- Controlled data access via MCP tool boundary with SQL Guard and read-only MySQL integration
- Fail-closed security and audit mechanisms with repeated authorization checks and immutable audit hash chains
- Frozen engineering benchmarks and reproducible evaluation metrics for retrieval and system performance

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a robust, security-hardened framework for building enterprise-grade RAG systems with strict control over retrieval, data access, and agent workflows, ensuring reliable and auditable decision-making.
