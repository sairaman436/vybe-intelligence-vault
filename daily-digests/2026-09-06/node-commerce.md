## Summary
A merchant-side SDK for AgentScore that provides a unified commerce solution with identity gating, payment rail helpers, 402 challenge builders, MPP discovery, and Stripe multichain support. Designed to work with any x402/MPP merchant in the ecosystem, including AgentScore-gated or non-gated merchants.

## Key Features
- Comprehensive merchant-side SDK for AgentScore with identity gating (KYC, sanctions, age, jurisdiction) and policy-based compliance helpers for multi-product merchants.
- Built-in payment rail helpers supporting x402, MPP, Stripe, Solana, and Tempo, with automatic USD-to-atomic conversion and zero-amount carve-outs.
- 402 challenge builders and structured 4xx validation error responses for standardized payment challenges and error handling.
- Discovery and agent-facing surfaces including `/skill.md` generation, UCP/JWKS publishing, and merchant index JSON for agent discovery.
- Framework-agnostic middleware for rate limiting, identity gating, and UCP route mounting, with adapters for Hono, Express, Fastify, Next.js, and Web Fetch.

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a critical toolkit for RAG/AI stack builders to integrate secure, compliant, and multi-rail payment and identity systems into agent-driven commerce applications.
