## Summary
Palinode provides auditable, git-versioned memory for AI agents by storing facts as markdown files in a git repository, indexed with hybrid search (BM25 + vector) and served via MCP. It enables human-readable, diffable, and rollback-able agent memory with zero external dependencies beyond SQLite and Ollama.

## Key Features
- Git-versioned markdown memory files with YAML frontmatter for human readability and auditability
- Hybrid search combining BM25 keyword and vector search (BGE-M3 embeddings) for precision and recall
- MCP-first architecture enabling seamless integration with multiple IDEs and agent frameworks
- Automated compaction and session capture with git commit history for rollback and provenance
- Single SQLite database file with zero external dependencies for indexing and storage

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Palinode enables RAG builders to create auditable, human-readable agent memory that can be diffed, blamed, and rolled back, ensuring transparency and reliability in AI-driven workflows.
