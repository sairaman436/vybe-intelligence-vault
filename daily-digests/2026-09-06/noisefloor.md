## Summary
A regression harness designed to measure run-to-run noise in non-deterministic systems before identifying true regressions. It runs target systems multiple times, establishes a noise baseline, and flags changes only when deltas exceed observed variance, ensuring reliable regression detection without false positives.

## Key Features
- Noise-gated regression detection: only flags changes when deltas exceed observed variance
- Supports binary and continuous scorers with tailored significance rules
- Stores raw outputs for rescorability and offline analysis
- Zero API key or network dependencies; runs locally with subprocess targets
- Built-in safeguards against command injection and target command changes

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a critical layer of reliability for RAG and AI systems by distinguishing true regressions from natural noise, reducing false positives in CI/CD pipelines.
