## Summary
NeuRAG is a local-first MCP server that provides LLMs with a structured, permanent knowledge base. It indexes directories, organizes content into a hierarchical node graph, and enables hybrid semantic/lexical search with cross-linking for enhanced retrieval.

## Key Features
- Hierarchical node organization (godnode → fundamental → specialization) for structured knowledge storage
- Hybrid search combining semantic (FastEmbed) and lexical (TF-IDF) retrieval with RRF fusion
- Automatic cross-linking between nodes using tag overlap and source file metadata with weighted evidence
- Adaptive chunking (AST-aware for code, heading splits for Markdown, page breaks for PDF) for optimized indexing
- Turso/libSQL native vector search with SQLite fallback, supporting standalone or gateway-managed deployments

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
NeuRAG provides a permanent, structured, and searchable knowledge vault for LLMs, eliminating the need for repeated context injection and enabling long-term memory with cross-referenced relationships.
