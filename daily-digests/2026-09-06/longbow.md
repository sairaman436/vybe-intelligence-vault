## Summary
Longbow is a distributed, high-performance vector engine designed for modern AI and agentic workloads, offering sub-millisecond latency through zero-copy data paths, SIMD optimizations, and advanced storage backends like Apache Arrow and io_uring.

## Key Features
- Zero-copy data transfer via Apache Arrow for high throughput and low latency
- Distributed architecture with consistent hashing and SWIM protocol for cluster membership
- Hardware-aware optimizations including NUMA, SIMD, and GPU acceleration (CUDA/Metal)
- Advanced storage backends with optional io_uring WAL and Parquet snapshots for durability
- Pluggable distance metrics, SIMD-accelerated metadata filtering, and polymorphic vector types

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Longbow is essential for RAG builders because it delivers sub-millisecond vector search latency at scale with hardware-optimized kernels, making it ideal for real-time AI applications requiring high throughput and low response times.
