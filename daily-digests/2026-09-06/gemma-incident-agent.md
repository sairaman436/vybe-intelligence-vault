## Summary
A local-first AI agent that investigates fictional microservice incidents using Gemma and Ollama. It orchestrates read-only tool calls to gather evidence, retrieves runbooks via hybrid RAG, and produces a schema-validated investigation report with safety controls and observability.

## Key Features
- Bounded agent loop with explicit evidence collection via read-only tools
- Hybrid lexical and embedding-based runbook retrieval with configurable weighting
- Schema-validated investigation reports using Pydantic and JSON Schema
- Safety controls including prompt validation, redaction, and no mutation tools
- Deterministic golden-case evaluation and unit tests for regression coverage

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It demonstrates a production-grade agent architecture for incident investigation, emphasizing evidence-based reasoning, safety, and reproducibility—critical for building reliable RAG systems.
