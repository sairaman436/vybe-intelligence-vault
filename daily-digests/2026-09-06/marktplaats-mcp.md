## Summary
marktplaats-mcp is an MCP server that enables AI agents like Claude, Cursor, and Codex to search and interact with Marktplaats and 2dehands, the Dutch and Belgian second-hand classifieds platforms. It provides structured, token-efficient access to listings, seller profiles, and monitoring tools without requiring an API key or account.

## Key Features
- Search listings with filters (price, condition, location, recency, etc.) across two marketplaces (Netherlands and Belgium)
- Retrieve full listing details including images, seller trust signals, and listing metadata
- Monitor new listings with stateless cursors for efficient polling
- Resilient HTTP client with retries, exponential backoff, and rate limit handling
- Zero dependency on official APIs or authentication; uses public endpoints

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides structured, real-time access to Dutch and Belgian classifieds data, enabling AI agents to perform localized searches and seller vetting for RAG applications.
