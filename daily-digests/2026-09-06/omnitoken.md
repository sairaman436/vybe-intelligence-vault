## Summary
OmniToken is a high-performance, hardware-adaptive tokenization engine written in Rust that supports BPE, WordPiece, and Unigram tokenization with universal vocabulary format ingestion and zero-copy I/O operations.

## Key Features
- Universal vocabulary format support (BPE, WordPiece, Unigram, tiktoken, SentencePiece, GGUF)
- Hardware-adaptive tokenization with AVX-512, ARM NEON, and GPU acceleration
- Zero-copy I/O via `.otk` binary blob format and kernel bypass (io_uring/DirectStorage)
- Structure-of-Arrays (SoA) Double-Array Trie for SIMD/GPU cache-coherent memory access
- Stable C-ABI and DLPack tensor handoff for seamless integration with PyTorch, vLLM, and JAX

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
OmniToken provides a unified, high-performance tokenization solution that eliminates bottlenecks in RAG pipelines by offering universal format support, GPU acceleration, and zero-copy tensor integration.
