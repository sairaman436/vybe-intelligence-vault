## Summary
mcp-freestyle is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that reads glucose data from Abbott's FreeStyle LibreLinkUp cloud service via an unofficial API. It integrates with MCP clients like Claude to provide real-time and historical glucose readings for diabetes management.

## Key Features
- Reads current glucose levels and historical data from FreeStyle sensors via LibreLinkUp cloud
- Secure credential storage using OS keychain (no secrets in config files)
- Provides tools for `get_current_glucose` and `get_glucose_history` with accurate time-in-range reporting
- Honest about data coverage and truncation (avoids misleading interpolations)
- Integrates seamlessly with MCP clients like Claude Desktop and Claude Code

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI assistants to access real-time and historical glucose data for diabetes management, bridging the gap between health IoT devices and AI-driven insights.
