## Summary
librenmsctrl is a CLI and MCP-compatible adapter for interacting with LibreNMS, an open-source network monitoring system. It provides typed command surfaces for inspecting devices, ports, alerts, and events via API-token authentication, with safety-gated write operations for agent workflows.

## Key Features
- Read-only CLI for LibreNMS monitoring (devices, ports, alerts, events)
- MCP-compatible adapter for agent workflows with structured tool output
- Three-tier write-gating system (reads, safe writes, destructive ops) with confirmation flags
- Input validation via TypeBox schemas and URL-encoded parameters to prevent injection
- API token redactor to mask credentials in logs and error output

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a secure, validated control surface for LibreNMS, enabling safe agent interactions with network monitoring data while preventing accidental or malicious state changes.
