## Summary
OMP Approval Reviewer is a security-focused extension for Oh My Pi (OMP) that acts as a policy-aware gatekeeper for Bash tool calls and sensitive operations. It inspects commands, enforces hard-coded safety policies, and optionally delegates to an LLM for structured allow/deny/escalate decisions while maintaining an auditable trail.

## Key Features
- Hard-coded emergency brake for destructive operations (e.g., root destruction, fork bombs) before any model call
- Isolated LLM review process with tools, sessions, and prewalk disabled for safety
- Append-only JSONL audit trail with redacted secrets and strict file permissions (0600)
- Static command/path analysis to classify actions as routine, denied, or requiring review
- Configurable trust boundaries with global and project-level hardening options

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a critical safety layer for AI-driven shell environments by enforcing deterministic security policies and auditable LLM-backed approvals before executing sensitive commands.
