## Summary
A security-hardened AI Bible study assistant for Telegram groups, built on the Claude Agent SDK and Model Context Protocol (MCP). It provides theological discussions, local voice transcription, and exact Bible verse lookups with comprehensive security measures and audit logging.

## Key Features
- 13-layer security hardening with defense-in-depth (rate limiting, path validation, command safety, audit logging)
- Exact Bible verse lookups via local MCP server with SQLite database (Schlachter 2000)
- Multi-modal input support (text, voice, photos, documents, video) with local whisper.cpp transcription
- Streaming responses and session management with persistence (/new, /stop, /resume commands)
- GDPR and EU AI Act compliance with transparent privacy documentation

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It demonstrates how to securely deploy AI agents in collaborative environments like Telegram groups while handling sensitive theological content and user data.
