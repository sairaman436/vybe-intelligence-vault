## Summary
A remote MCP server deployed on Cloudflare Workers that exposes a rationale store (decisions, pipelines, constraints) via Streamable HTTP. It functions as a claude.ai custom connector, enabling access to project context from any device without requiring a local machine to be running.

## Key Features
- One-click deployment to Cloudflare Workers with auto-provisioned D1 database
- Stateless MCP server with runtime schema migration and no Durable Objects dependency
- Secret-path authentication embedded in the URL for secure access
- Unified tools for recording, querying, and managing project context (decisions, pipelines, constraints)
- Bulk import/export and synchronization capabilities for existing local data

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents and users to access and manage project rationale and constraints remotely without infrastructure dependencies, enhancing collaboration and continuity across devices.
