## Summary
pubtator-link is an MCP (Streamable HTTP) server that provides a rate-limited, compact, and citable interface to NCBI's PubTator3 biomedical literature API. It enables efficient literature review workflows by returning structured passages instead of raw BioC documents and supports durable review indexing with Postgres/pgvector for evidence retrieval and auditing.

## Key Features
- Compact, citable passage retrieval from PubMed/PMC literature instead of raw BioC documents
- Rate-limited client to respect PubTator3 API constraints (3 requests/second)
- Durable review indexing with Postgres/pgvector for persistent evidence storage and auditing
- MCP server integration for seamless AI agent workflows
- Support for entity and relation extraction (genes, diseases, chemicals, variants, etc.)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It streamlines biomedical literature retrieval for RAG systems by providing compact, citable passages and durable indexing, reducing context waste and enabling efficient evidence-based AI workflows.
