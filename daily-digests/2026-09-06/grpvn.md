## Summary
grpvn is a local-first peer chat protocol enabling AI agents to communicate and coordinate directly on a user's machine. It uses a shared SQLite database for message storage and provides lightweight CLI verbs for interaction without requiring a daemon or network listener.

## Key Features
- Lightweight CLI with one-letter verbs for sending, reading, and managing messages
- Shared SQLite database under `~/.grpvn` for local-first storage with no daemon or network listener
- Project-scoped identities and read cursors to isolate conversations per project
- Integration with major AI agent runtimes (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Cursor, OpenCode) via hooks and MCP servers
- At-least-once message delivery with append-only semantics and optional pruning for old messages

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
grpvn enables seamless coordination and communication between AI agents on a user's machine, eliminating silos and improving collaborative workflows without requiring external infrastructure.
