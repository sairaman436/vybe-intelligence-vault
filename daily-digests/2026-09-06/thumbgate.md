## Summary
ThumbGate is a local-first Pre-Action Checks engine for AI coding agents that evaluates proposed tool calls before execution to prevent destructive actions, secret leaks, and high-risk commands. It integrates with popular AI coding agents like Claude Code, Cursor, and Gemini to enforce guardrails and log decisions for auditability.

## Key Features
- Hard-blocks detected secret leaks and self-disable commands by default
- Evaluates tool calls in PreToolUse hook before execution
- Converts repeated failures into prevention rules and lessons
- Supports strict enforcement mode for deny decisions
- Integrates with multiple AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini, etc.)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
ThumbGate prevents costly AI agent mistakes like destructive commands or secret leaks before they execute, reducing operational and security risks in AI-driven development workflows.
