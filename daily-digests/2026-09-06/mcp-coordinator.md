## Summary
mcp-coordinator is a daemon that prevents conflicts between AI coding agents (e.g., Claude Code, Cursor) by providing a shared coordination layer over MQTT. It enables agents to announce their intentions before modifying files, detect potential conflicts, and resolve them collaboratively in real-time.

## Key Features
- Embedded MQTT broker for real-time event streaming between agents
- 26 MCP tools for agent coordination, including `announce_work`, `post_to_thread`, and `register_agent`
- Impact scoring system to detect and resolve conflicts before code is written
- Support for polling and push-based event delivery (via Channels)
- Comprehensive authentication (OAuth 2.1, 4 IdPs) and audit logging for regulated environments

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It eliminates AI agent conflicts in collaborative coding environments by providing a shared coordination layer, ensuring agents work in harmony without overwriting each other's changes.
