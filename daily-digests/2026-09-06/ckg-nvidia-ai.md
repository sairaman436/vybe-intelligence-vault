## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server providing a Compressed Knowledge Graph (CKG) for the NVIDIA AI developer stack, offering 20 domains and 998 nodes of structured, deterministic dependency relationships. It enables agents to traverse declared prerequisites and capabilities instead of relying on retrieval or inference, reducing token usage by 11x while improving accuracy.

## Key Features
- Structured dependency graph with 20 NVIDIA AI domains and 998 nodes for deterministic traversal
- Read-only MCP server that never mutates data, ensuring auditability and precision
- Reduces token usage by 11x compared to RAG while improving F1 accuracy (0.471)
- Typed edges (REQUIRES, ENABLES, RELATES_TO, IMPLEMENTS) for semantic precision in agent queries
- Supports natural-language grounding via Ollama (Qwen2.5:14b) for locally executed, graph-grounded responses

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It eliminates redundant context in AI pipelines by providing structured, traversable knowledge of NVIDIA's AI stack, enabling agents to operate with 11x fewer tokens and higher accuracy than traditional RAG approaches.
