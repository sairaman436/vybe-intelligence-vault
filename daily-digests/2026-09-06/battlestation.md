## Summary
A CLI tool and MCP server for capturing, diffing, and restoring macOS system preferences to/from an auditable TOML file. It manages ~150 curated settings, including hidden preferences not exposed in System Settings, and supports declarative restoration on new machines.

## Key Features
- Captures ~150 macOS system settings to a structured TOML file with detailed annotations
- Supports diffing live system against stored preferences for auditing changes
- Declarative apply command restores settings and removes unspecified ones to reset to defaults
- Includes an MCP server for programmatic access via AI assistants or scripts
- Provides undo snapshots and dry-run modes for safe, reversible operations

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI engineers to programmatically capture and restore macOS system configurations, ensuring consistent development environments and reducing setup friction for new machines.
