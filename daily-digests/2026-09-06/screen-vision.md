## Summary
A CLI toolkit for capturing desktop window screenshots and extracting structured UI elements (buttons, text) as pixel-accurate, clickable JSON. It prioritizes accessibility tree data (UIA) for reliability, with OCR as a fallback, and supports optional dry-run or actual clicks.

## Key Features
- Hybrid UI element detection using accessibility tree (UIA) with OCR fallback for gaps
- DPI-aware capture and coordinate mapping to avoid misalignment issues
- Read-only by default with optional dry-run and explicit click actions
- Stateless CLI scripts (probe, capture, click) for minimal resource overhead
- Supports native Windows apps, Electron, and WinUI with cross-platform OCR options

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides reliable, structured desktop UI data for RAG systems that need to interact with or analyze native applications beyond the browser.
