## Summary
A reference implementation of a Kerberized MCP server for FreeIPA environments that enables enterprise single sign-on using existing Kerberos tickets. It authenticates and authorizes users via SPNEGO without storing passwords or API keys, and supports on-behalf-of delegation for downstream services.

## Key Features
- Kerberos-based authentication via SPNEGO without storing user secrets
- Group-based authorization using FreeIPA directory membership
- On-behalf-of delegation for downstream Kerberized services
- Secure socket forwarding over SSH with no credential exposure
- Reference implementation with stub tools for easy adaptation

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a secure, enterprise-grade authentication and authorization layer for MCP servers in FreeIPA environments, eliminating the need for per-developer secrets while enabling seamless integration with existing Kerberos infrastructures.
