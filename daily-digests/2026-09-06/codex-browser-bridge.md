## Summary
codex-browser-bridge enables MCP-compatible agents like Claude Code to control a local Chrome browser via Codex Desktop's browser bridge. It exposes 52 MCP tools for browser automation, DOM interaction, and network operations, all packaged as a single Rust binary with zero configuration.

## Key Features
- 52 MCP tools for comprehensive browser control (tabs, navigation, DOM, input, network, etc.)
- Pure Rust single binary with zero configuration required
- Direct integration with Codex Desktop's Chrome bridge via named pipes
- Built-in safety limits for large responses (text/image bytes, CDP diagnostics)
- Self-diagnostic tool (`codex_doctor`) and agent skill for optimal usage

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It bridges the gap between AI agents and real browser sessions, enabling agents to interact with dynamic, authenticated, or complex web interfaces essential for RAG pipelines.
