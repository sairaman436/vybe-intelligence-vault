## Summary
resharper-cli-mcp is an MCP server that wraps JetBrains' ReSharper command-line tools to provide C# coding agents with real-time code inspection and cleanup capabilities via stdio. It enables agents to perform ReSharper inspections and apply code cleanup rules without requiring an IDE or JetBrains license.

## Key Features
- Exposes ReSharper InspectCode for real-time code issue detection via `resharper_inspect` tool
- Applies ReSharper CleanupCode in-place for code formatting and style normalization via `resharper_cleanup` tool
- Supports deriving intentional style guides for legacy codebases using the `derive_style_guide` prompt
- Configurable via environment variables and MCP client settings for solution path, cache location, and ReSharper plugins
- Provides detailed issue reporting with file, line, severity, rule ID, and message for each detected problem

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI coding agents to leverage JetBrains ReSharper's powerful static analysis and code cleanup capabilities in headless environments, improving code quality and consistency in automated workflows.
