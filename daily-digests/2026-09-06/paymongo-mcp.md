## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates PayMongo's payment gateway API, enabling AI assistants to accept online payments in the Philippines (GCash, GrabPay, cards) via 24 tools for payment intents, sources, refunds, webhooks, and customer management.

## Key Features
- 24 tools covering payments, refunds, webhooks, and customer management via PayMongo API
- Safety mechanisms to prevent accidental live transactions (opt-in required for live keys)
- Local webhook signature verification for secure event handling
- Lazy client initialization (tools list without API key, reducing startup crashes)
- Support for GCash, GrabPay, cards, and payment links with no-code integration

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI assistants to seamlessly process payments in the Philippines without writing gateway-specific code, reducing integration complexity for RAG builders.
