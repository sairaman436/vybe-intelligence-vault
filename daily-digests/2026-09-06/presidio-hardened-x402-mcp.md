## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that acts as a pre-payment safety gate for x402 agentic payments, detecting and redacting PII in payment metadata, enforcing spending policies, and preventing duplicate payments before transactions are signed or executed.

## Key Features
- Pre-payment PII screening in payment metadata (emails, names, etc.) to prevent unintended data leakage
- Spending policy enforcement with configurable per-call, daily, and per-endpoint limits
- Duplicate payment detection via HMAC-SHA256 fingerprinting with cross-process support
- Zero-config in-process mode or optional HTTP-proxy mode for centralized screening
- Designed for composability with other MCP servers (e.g., endpoint safety, payment execution)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It ensures agentic payments are secure and compliant by catching PII leaks, budget overruns, and duplicate transactions before any data or funds leave the agent host.
