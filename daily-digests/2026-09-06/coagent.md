## Summary
coagent is a self-hosted, headless coding agent designed for unattended task handoff. It runs as a long-lived daemon, accepts tasks via Telegram or local chat, and manages durable sessions with SQLite persistence, subagents, schedules, and MCP server integrations.

## Key Features
- Durable work persistence with SQLite for sessions, schedules, and subagent relationships
- Headless operation with Telegram or local Unix socket control, no TCP listener or web UI
- Subagent delegation for parallel or hierarchical task execution with isolated contexts
- Built-in tools for code inspection, editing, testing, and project memory management
- Strict security model with opt-in write confinement, secrets management, and sandboxing

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
coagent enables unattended, durable task execution for AI agents, making it essential for building robust, production-grade autonomous coding systems.
