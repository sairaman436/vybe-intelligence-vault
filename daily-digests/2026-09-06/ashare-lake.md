## Summary
ashare-lake is a locally updatable A-share research lake that provides daily historical and point-in-time (PIT) financial data for Chinese stocks. It aggregates multi-source data into a curated Parquet lake with row-level lineage, enabling survivorship-bias-free research and AI agent integration.

## Key Features
- 39 curated datasets covering equities, futures, fundamentals, valuation, and macro indicators with row-level lineage
- Daily incremental updates with local storage to avoid API dependency and survivorship bias
- Point-in-time (PIT) data access for accurate historical analysis without look-ahead bias
- Integration with AI agents via MCP (6 tools) for natural language querying of financial data
- Supports complex queries like historical PE percentiles, IC calculations, and delisting event analysis

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a locally maintainable, survivorship-bias-free A-share data lake essential for accurate RAG-based financial research and AI agent decision-making.
