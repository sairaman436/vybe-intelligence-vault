## Summary
A Docker-based Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI agents (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Claude) with direct access to a full Kali Linux penetration testing toolkit. The server runs a Flask API inside a Kali container, executing tools in an isolated environment based on AI agent requests.

## Key Features
- 17 MCP tool modules exposing 131+ Kali Linux tools (e.g., Nmap, SQLMap, Hydra, Metasploit) to AI agents
- Isolated Docker-based execution environment for secure tool invocation
- Flask API backend translating MCP tool calls into Kali tool executions
- Configurable tool profiles (e.g., `core`, `recon`, `web`, `ad`, `full`) for tailored AI agent interactions
- Support for VPN, reverse shells, network pivoting, and AD attack tools

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to autonomously execute penetration testing and security assessment tools, bridging the gap between AI-driven automation and real-world security operations.
