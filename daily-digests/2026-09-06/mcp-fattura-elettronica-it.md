## Summary
A Python MCP server for generating, validating, and analyzing Italian electronic invoices (FatturaPA XML) compliant with the Sistema di Interscambio (SDI) standards. It provides 42 tools for handling the full lifecycle of B2B, B2G, and cross-border invoices, including XSD validation, digital signatures, SDI transmission, and legally compliant archiving.

## Key Features
- Full lifecycle FatturaPA XML document management (generation, validation, parsing)
- 42 MCP tools covering transmission headers, VAT computation, digital signatures, and SDI transmission
- Support for simplified invoices (VFSM10) and cross-border transactions
- XSD validation against official Agenzia delle Entrate schema (v1.2.3)
- Legally compliant archiving (conservazione sostitutiva) with SHA-256 integrity checks

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
This repository provides essential tools for AI agents to generate, validate, and process Italian electronic invoices in compliance with SDI standards, enabling seamless integration with Italy's tax and invoicing ecosystem.
