## Summary
Embassy is a local, bidirectional messaging gateway that enables Claude Code sessions and Codex desktop tasks to communicate securely on the same machine without plugins or cloud relays. It acts as a consent-first broker for explicit agent pairing, message routing, and delivery tracking.

## Key Features
- Explicit agent pairing with consent-first model for bidirectional messaging between Claude Code and Codex tasks
- In-memory message routing with bounded delivery semantics and receipt tracking
- Live and static bilingual dashboard for monitoring deliveries, routes, and activity
- Local-only deployment with Unix domain sockets and no external API calls
- Supports multiple concurrent agent pairs with configurable limits and delivery states

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Embassy bridges a critical gap in AI agent ecosystems by enabling secure, local communication between otherwise isolated agent environments, enhancing collaboration without compromising privacy or requiring cloud relays.
