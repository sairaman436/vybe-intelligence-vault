## Summary
mcp-stdio is a bidirectional stdio-to-HTTP gateway that enables MCP clients like Claude Desktop to connect to remote HTTP-based MCP servers, supporting authentication methods such as Bearer tokens, custom headers, and OAuth 2.1 with PKCE.

## Key Features
- Supports both Streamable HTTP and SSE MCP transports with protocol-era auto-detection
- Built-in OAuth 2.1 client with PKCE, dynamic client registration, and token refresh
- Handles authentication via Bearer tokens, custom headers, and OAuth flows
- Auto-pagination for tools/resources/prompts lists in Streamable HTTP transport
- Proactive token refresh and step-up authorization for seamless session continuity

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It bridges MCP clients to remote servers, enabling secure and flexible integration with AI agents and tools while handling authentication and protocol complexities transparently.
