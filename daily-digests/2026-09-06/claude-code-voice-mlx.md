## Summary
A local neural text-to-speech system for parallel Claude Code sessions that serializes audio output from multiple agents into a single, ordered queue with project identification. Uses Apple MLX for offline, low-latency TTS (0.3s to first sound) and integrates with macOS for hands-free coding feedback.

## Key Features
- Global audio queue for concurrent sessions with ordered playback and project identification
- Resident MLX-based TTS daemon (Kokoro) for sub-0.3s latency and zero API costs
- Dynamic status display in macOS notch showing active speaker and queue depth
- Sentence pipelining for seamless transitions between utterances
- Chinese and English voice support with per-session barge-in control

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables hands-free, eyes-free monitoring of parallel AI agents by converting their outputs into a single, intelligible audio stream with minimal latency and no external dependencies.
