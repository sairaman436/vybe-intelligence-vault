## Summary
IFTA Agent is a production-ready quarterly fuel-tax filing pipeline for interstate carriers that combines deterministic mathematical calculations with an LLM review agent. It automates the ingestion of messy mileage and fuel data, computes tax filings, and validates them against regulations and historical filings using an 18-tool grounded agent.

## Key Features
- Deterministic pipeline for accurate tax calculations (penny-accurate regression tested)
- 18 grounded LLM tools for regulatory review and validation
- Telegram intake bot for customer file uploads and automated processing
- Multi-tenant FastAPI service with layered eval harness for quality control
- Historical filing comparison and rate matrix caching for efficiency

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It demonstrates how to combine deterministic computation with LLM-based validation for high-stakes regulatory filings, ensuring accuracy and trustworthiness in AI-driven workflows.
