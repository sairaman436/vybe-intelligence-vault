## Summary
Metatron is a self-hosted system that captures a codebase's implementation decisions, conventions, and edge cases as structured records, serving them to coding agents over MCP to enable behavior akin to a senior engineer familiar with the codebase.

## Key Features
- Structured decision records with human-gated curation (candidates vs. canonical decisions)
- Serves conventions and edge cases to agents over MCP for context-aware coding
- Git-native audit trail for decisions (OKF export to markdown files)
- Feedback loop for agent-reported gaps to refine and expand conventions
- Supports both MCP and files-first modes for flexibility in deployment

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Metatron provides critical, curated context about a codebase's conventions and edge cases to AI agents, enabling them to write code that aligns with team standards and avoids common pitfalls, significantly improving code quality and reducing debugging time.
