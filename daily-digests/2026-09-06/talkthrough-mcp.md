## Summary
talkthrough-mcp is an MCP server that converts narrated screen recordings or video/audio files into structured, agent-ready data including transcripts, keyframes, OCR text, and wall-clock-anchored timestamps. It enables AI agents to process local media files without cloud dependencies, supporting lazy retrieval for efficient context management.

## Key Features
- Converts narrated screen recordings into structured data with wall-clock-anchored timestamps for precise event mapping
- Supports lazy retrieval of transcript segments, frames, and OCR text to avoid context flooding
- Includes optional speaker diarization for multi-person recordings
- Works entirely locally with no cloud dependencies (FFmpeg, Whisper, OCR run on-device)
- Provides 7 MCP tools and 5 server prompts for agent workflows like triage, spec generation, and backlog creation

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to process and query local media files efficiently, bridging the gap between unstructured recordings and structured agent-ready data without cloud dependencies.
