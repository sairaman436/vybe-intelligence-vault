## Summary
linctl is a Go-based CLI tool designed to provide a secure, agent-friendly interface for Linear (project management) operations. It enforces target-pinned guarded writes, ensuring writes fail closed if the resolved OAuth credential does not match the pinned target, preventing accidental mutations in wrong teams or orgs.

## Key Features
- Target-pinned guarded writes: enforces strict org/team matching for mutations, failing closed on mismatch
- No standing context cost: reads only incur token costs when executed, unlike MCP servers
- Structured, pipeable output: supports JSON, compact, and field-filtered formats for scripting
- Deterministic and secure: no bypass flags, OAuth credential resolution at command time
- Agent-first design: minimal tool definitions (~400 tokens) and deterministic outputs for LLM agents

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a secure, agent-friendly way to interact with Linear while preventing accidental writes to the wrong teams or organizations, critical for AI-driven automation.
