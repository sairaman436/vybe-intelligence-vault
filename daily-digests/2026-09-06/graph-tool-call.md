## Summary
graph-tool-call is a Python library that enables LLM agents to retrieve multi-step tool workflows from large tool sets using a graph-based approach, reducing token usage by up to 91% while improving accuracy. It supports OpenAPI, MCP, and Python functions, and integrates with LangChain and MCP proxies.

## Key Features
- Builds tool graphs from OpenAPI specs, MCP servers, or Python functions to model tool relationships and workflows
- Hybrid retrieval combining BM25, graph traversal, embeddings, and MCP annotations for precise multi-step tool chains
- Reduces token usage by 64–91% while maintaining or improving retrieval accuracy (e.g., 82% accuracy for 248 K8s tools)
- Supports workflow planning with ordered execution chains to minimize agent round-trips
- Zero-dependency core with modular extras for embeddings, MCP, OpenAPI, LangChain, and visualization

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It solves the critical problem of context overflow and workflow fragmentation in LLM agents by enabling precise, multi-step tool retrieval from large tool sets, drastically reducing token usage while improving accuracy.
