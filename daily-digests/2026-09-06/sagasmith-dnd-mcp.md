## Summary
SagaSmith D&D MCP is a server-side boundary service that exposes D&D 5e agent capabilities via the MCP (Model Context Protocol) standard. It dynamically manages tool exposure based on campaign phases, ensuring minimal and secure tool access for AI agents while maintaining session isolation and state consistency.

## Key Features
- Session-level tool exposure based on campaign phases (lobby, play, combat) with automatic tool loading/unloading
- Stateful campaign management with branch DAG, snapshots, and revision control
- Rule and module import with strict versioning, checksum validation, and OCR support
- Portable actor cards and structured module packages for cross-campaign compatibility
- Vector embedding-backed retrieval for rules, skills, and campaign memory

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a secure, phase-aware MCP server for D&D 5e agents, enabling dynamic tool exposure and stateful campaign management essential for building reliable RAG systems in tabletop gaming contexts.
