## Summary
COD-DOC is a context orchestrator for documentation that ensures docs never drift from code by using a SQLite-based state database where markdown is a hash-verified projection. It provides a unified interface for humans and LLM agents to manage, query, and audit project documentation, tasks, and revisions.

## Key Features
- Hash-verified markdown projections to detect drift between docs and code
- Append-only revision history with revert capabilities for all entities
- First-class linking between documents, tasks, ADRs, and git commits
- Dedicated MCP profile for LLM agents with 6 task-centric tools
- Zero infrastructure dependency with a single SQLite file for the project state

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
COD-DOC ensures documentation remains accurate and synchronized with code, providing a reliable foundation for RAG systems that rely on up-to-date project context.
