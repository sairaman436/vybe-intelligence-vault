## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data access via tools for fetching CPI, unemployment, wages, JOLTS, and other economic indicators. Supports both STDIO and Streamable HTTP transports with optional DataCanvas SQL analysis for large datasets.

## Key Features
- Seven specialized tools for BLS data access (surveys, SeriesID resolution, historical data, latest values)
- Offline series catalog search with LABSTAT flat files to avoid API quota consumption
- Optional DataCanvas SQL analysis for large multi-series datasets with DuckDB backend
- Supports both STDIO and Streamable HTTP transports with Docker and npm deployment options
- Period-over-period calculations and quota tracking for BLS API v2 integration

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
This server provides structured, programmatic access to critical US labor and economic data, enabling RAG systems to enrich responses with authoritative, up-to-date statistics without manual data scraping or API integration overhead.
