## Summary
p-layer is a memory management system for AI agents that enforces structured, rule-based long-term memory with strict governance. It organizes memory into hierarchical layers (P0-P6) with enforced access controls, ensures non-destructive versioning, and provides audit trails for all operations.

## Key Features
- Hierarchical memory layers (P0-P6) with enforced access controls and authority hierarchy
- Non-destructive versioning with supersede semantics instead of deletion
- Real-time rule enforcement at write time with audit logging for all operations
- Hybrid retrieval (semantic + keyword) with ranking by confidence and freshness
- Dual storage backend (SQLite for personal use, PostgreSQL for teams) with identical behavior

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a robust, rule-enforced memory system for AI agents that prevents hallucinations and ensures consistent long-term recall, critical for production-grade RAG applications.
