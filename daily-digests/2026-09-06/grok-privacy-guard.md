## Summary
A privacy guard for the Grok CLI that adds a default-deny layer to prevent unauthorized codebase uploads, session trace uploads, and other privacy risks. It acts as a shim between user input and the Grok binary, enforcing security checks before and after execution.

## Key Features
- Shim-based interception of Grok CLI commands to enforce security checks before execution
- Five-layer protection system (command entry, config hard-off, binary fingerprinting, pre-checks, post-execution evidence validation)
- Automatic configuration hardening (disables auto-updates, codebase uploads, telemetry, and trace uploads)
- SHA-256 binary fingerprinting to detect tampering or upgrades
- Post-execution validation of logs and upload queues to detect runtime privacy violations

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a critical local security layer for RAG/AI stack builders using Grok CLI by preventing unintended data exfiltration and enforcing privacy controls at runtime.
