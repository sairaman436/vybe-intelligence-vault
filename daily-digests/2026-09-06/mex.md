## Summary
mex is a CLI tool and MCP server that provides persistent project memory for AI coding agents, enabling structured context retention between sessions. It creates and maintains a scaffold of markdown files and automates drift detection to keep agent instructions aligned with the codebase.

## Key Features
- Structured markdown scaffold for persistent agent memory (e.g., AGENTS.md, ROUTER.md, context/patterns/)
- Drift detection with 11 automated checkers to validate scaffold against the codebase
- CLI commands for setup, sync, logging, and health checks (e.g., mex setup, mex check, mex sync)
- MCP server integration for native tool calls in AI agents (e.g., mex_check, mex_log, mex_read_file)
- Cross-platform support with Windows compatibility and global/local installation options

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It eliminates context window bloat and token waste for AI agents by maintaining persistent, structured project memory and automated drift detection.
