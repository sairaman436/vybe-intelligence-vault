## Summary
Nólë is a local, free-first/BYOK web search and page extraction router designed to enhance AI agents and coding CLI tools by providing a controlled, provider-agnostic layer for internet access. It enables agents to delegate web search, URL extraction, and source discovery while maintaining cost control and privacy.

## Key Features
- Free-first/BYOK provider routing with keyless fallbacks (DDGS, Wikipedia, arXiv, httpfetch)
- Multi-agent support (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Kimi, Hermes, Cursor, etc.) with automated setup scripts
- Task-based routing with deterministic intent classification and route planning
- Untrusted-content safety scanning and sanitization with content safety receipts
- Local binary deployment with optional Python-based extraction (Scrapling) and Go-based httpfetch fallback

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Nólë provides a critical local routing layer for RAG builders, enabling cost-controlled, privacy-preserving web search and content extraction for AI agents without relying on hosted SaaS solutions.
