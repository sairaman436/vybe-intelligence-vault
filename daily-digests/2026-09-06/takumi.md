## Summary
Takumi is a terminal-native Rust-based coding agent harness that operates as a client to the Chitragupta control plane daemon. It provides a full-screen TUI for interacting with an agent loop, workspace tools, and plugin systems while enforcing strict boundaries between control, execution, task graph, and learning planes.

## Key Features
- Full-screen Ratatui TUI with streaming transcript, slash commands, and modal approvals
- Daemon-backed agent loop with 18 workspace-scoped tools and MCP/plugin integration
- Witness verifier lane for isolated code-diff review before task completion
- Task graph with delegated nodes, provider/model binding per node, and dependency edges
- Quarantined learning plane for outcome comparison and operator-gated adaptation

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Takumi provides a structured, daemon-backed terminal agent framework with strict boundaries for control, execution, and verification, making it essential for building reliable, inspectable AI coding workflows.
