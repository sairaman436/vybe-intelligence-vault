## Summary
A Discord CLI and MCP server that operates as a user account, enabling reading, sending, searching, and managing any server or DM without requiring bot invitations. It provides agent-native JSON/JSONL output, SQLite-based offline archiving with FTS5 search, and stealth-aware fingerprinting for safe automation.

## Key Features
- Operates as a user account, granting access to all servers, DMs, and threads without bot invitations
- Agent-native output with JSON/JSONL envelopes and exit-code contracts for programmatic use
- SQLite-based offline archive with FTS5 full-text search for instant querying
- Stealth-aware fingerprinting (UA, X-Super-Properties, device_id) to mimic real client behavior
- MCP server integration for direct tool access in AI agents like Claude Code

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to interact with Discord as a user account, providing real-time data access and offline search capabilities essential for building comprehensive RAG systems.
