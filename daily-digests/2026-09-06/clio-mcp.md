## Summary
Clio MCP Server is an open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) connector that enables Claude to securely access live data from Clio Practice Management, including matters, contacts, tasks, and documents. It prioritizes compliance with ABA Opinion 512 and attorney-client privilege by logging all tool calls locally and encrypting OAuth tokens at rest.

## Key Features
- Secure OAuth 2.0 authentication with encrypted token storage (AES-256-GCM)
- Comprehensive audit logging for ABA Opinion 512 compliance
- Supports 34 Clio tools (read/write) across matters, tasks, contacts, and billing
- Local-first architecture with no relay server or cloud data retention
- Read-only mode and configurable write permissions for granular access control

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables secure, compliant integration of Clio's practice management data with AI workflows like Claude, ensuring attorney-client privilege and regulatory compliance while avoiding data exposure risks.
