## Summary
A daily business opportunity discovery system that aggregates signals from multiple sources, scores them deterministically, and pushes high-quality opportunities to Discord while archiving them. It uses an LLM for proposal generation but relies on a deterministic gate for final selection to ensure reliability.

## Key Features
- Multi-source signal aggregation (HackerNews, Product Hunt, X/Twitter, GitHub, etc.) with ≥2 independent origins required for inclusion
- Deterministic scoring rubric using LLM proposals but fail-closed Python gates for final selection
- Cross-day deduplication and evolution tracking to avoid noise and ensure relevance
- Tiered Discord delivery (immediate push for high-scoring opportunities, daily digest for others) with private archive
- Idempotent state management and reproducible scoring for reliability

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a reliable, automated pipeline for surfacing high-signal business opportunities daily, reducing manual research overhead for AI-driven decision-making.
