## Summary
OokCite MCP Server is a lightweight MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables tools to validate DOIs, format citations, manage bibliography collections, and detect fabricated references. It acts as a bridge to the OokCite API, providing structured citation metadata without handling full-text articles or PDFs.

## Key Features
- Validates DOIs to prevent hallucinated references in RAG outputs
- Formats citations in 2900+ CSL styles for standardized outputs
- Manages bibliography collections with batch operations for efficiency
- Supports reverse lookup from messy citation text to structured metadata
- Integrates seamlessly with MCP-capable clients for AI workflows

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It ensures accurate, verifiable citations in RAG outputs by validating DOIs and formatting references, reducing hallucinations and improving trust in AI-generated content.
