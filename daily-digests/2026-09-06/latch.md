## Summary
Latch is a local-first runtime gate that enforces ratified project decisions and rejected paths for AI agents, preventing them from revisiting or rebuilding previously dismissed solutions. It ensures decision continuity by checking agent actions against a knowledge base before any file changes occur.

## Key Features
- Runtime gate that checks agent actions against ratified decisions before file changes
- Local SQLite knowledge base for storing project decisions and rejected paths
- Cross-agent compatibility (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor) with shared decision continuity
- Receipt-based auditing with cited evidence for every gate decision
- Review-first seeding process to backfill existing project decisions

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Latch ensures AI agents adhere to project-specific decisions and constraints, reducing redundant work and preventing silent drift from ratified paths, which is critical for maintaining consistency in RAG and agent-based systems.
