## Summary
minimal-slack-bot is a lightweight, self-hosted AI agent for Slack built on the Claude Agent SDK. It operates as a single Bun process on your local machine, connecting to Slack via Socket Mode without requiring a public URL or server deployment. The bot enables real-time repository access, code editing, and command execution with Slack-based approval workflows.

## Key Features
- Single-process deployment with Bun and pm2, no cloud dependencies
- Channel and thread-scoped Claude sessions with durable memory via SQLite
- Real repository access with permission gating and Bash safety hooks
- Slack-based approval workflows for file edits and command execution
- Support for multiple Anthropic-compatible providers and model aliases

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a minimal, auditable self-hosted AI agent framework for Slack that integrates directly with local repositories and enforces permission controls, ideal for teams prioritizing privacy and control over cloud-based solutions.
