## Summary
OpenCode Goal is a persistent `/goal` workflow plugin for OpenCode that enables defining completion conditions once and letting the AI work across turns until an independent evaluator verifies the goal is satisfied. It combines evaluation, session persistence, and optional budget controls for unattended runs.

## Key Features
- Persistent goal tracking across OpenCode sessions with independent evaluator verification
- Optional token and turn budgets to cap unattended runs
- Pause, resume, clear, and status controls for goal management
- Model tools for querying and updating goal state dynamically
- Safe interruption handling and provider-failure resilience

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables autonomous, goal-driven AI workflows with independent verification, reducing manual oversight and improving reliability for long-running tasks.
