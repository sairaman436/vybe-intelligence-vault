## Summary
ryu-voice is a self-contained Python HTTP sidecar for text-to-speech (TTS) that integrates multiple TTS engines (Kokoro, Kitten, Pocket) into the Ryu ecosystem. It provides a unified API for TTS operations while abstracting engine-specific complexities.

## Key Features
- Unified HTTP API for multiple TTS engines (Kokoro, Kitten, Pocket) with a single contract
- Modular engine registry allowing easy addition of new TTS backends via `EngineConfig` and protocol implementations
- Lazy dependency loading to avoid heavy inference dependencies unless explicitly used
- Designed as a sidecar process for out-of-process TTS inference, managed by Core
- Supports model auto-download and voice pack injection for seamless integration

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
ryu-voice simplifies integration of multiple TTS engines into RAG pipelines by providing a standardized, scalable HTTP interface that abstracts engine-specific complexities.
