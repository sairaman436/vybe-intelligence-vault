## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server enabling AI agents to understand, generate, and reason over images and videos using multiple providers like Gemini, OpenAI, and Grok. Supports both text-to-image/video and image-to-image/video workflows with configurable quality tiers and multi-provider fallback.

## Key Features
- Multimodal understanding and generation for images and videos across multiple providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Grok)
- Support for text-to-image/video, image-to-image/video, and editing/inpainting workflows
- Configurable quality tiers (poor/rich) and auto-fallback between providers
- Dual transport modes: stdio (default) and HTTP (multi-user, self-hostable)
- Response caching, degraded mode for missing credentials, and SSRF/LFI prevention

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a unified, self-hostable interface for AI agents to interact with multimodal capabilities, reducing integration complexity and enabling scalable, multi-provider fallback for image and video tasks.
