## Summary
MCP Rancher is a capability-aware Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to operate Rancher-managed Kubernetes clusters through standardized tooling. It bridges Rancher's dual API planes (Norman and Steve) with a safety-first, audit-logged, and rate-limited interface for discovery, resource management, and operator workflows.

## Key Features
- Capability-aware tooling that adapts to Rancher versions (2.6.5–2.9.3+) without version-specific builds
- 319 pre-defined tools covering discovery, generic CRUD, curated reads/writes, and operator rollups with safety annotations
- Multi-instance support with read-only mode, rate limiting, and confirmation guards for destructive operations
- Structured audit logging, secret masking, and error envelopes for robust security and observability
- Automated tool manifest generation and drift gates to ensure consistency between code and documentation

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a standardized, safe, and auditable interface to manage Rancher-managed Kubernetes clusters, enabling AI agents to perform infrastructure operations without compromising security or compatibility.
