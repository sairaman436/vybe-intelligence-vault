## Summary
A Claude Code plugin that answers product-specific Discord user queries using only public documentation, enforced by fail-closed leak guards and founder escalation for uncertain responses. Designed to prevent accidental secret or PII leakage while providing grounded, citable answers.

## Key Features
- Fail-closed security model with four deterministic leak guards (permissions, PreToolUse hook, stdlib detection, egress DLP gate)
- Public documentation-only retrieval with strict allowlist/denylist enforcement
- Founder escalation for uncertain or out-of-bound queries
- Configurable per-product knowledge boundaries via isolated policy files
- Human-reviewed draft mode before auto-posting (MVP stage)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a secure, fail-closed framework for building AI-powered support bots that answer Discord queries without risking secret or PII leakage, critical for RAG systems handling sensitive product documentation.
