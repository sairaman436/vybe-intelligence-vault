## Summary
An LLM agent that evaluates a candidate's fit for a job posting by analyzing their CV and GitHub evidence. It generates a match report and cover-letter draft with citations, using a from-scratch tool loop, safety budgets, and a trajectory-evaluation harness for reproducibility and anti-hallucination guardrails.

## Key Features
- From-scratch tool loop with no agent framework dependency, enabling full control over control flow and safety budgets
- Safety budgets (max_steps, max_tokens, max_cost) with controlled stops to prevent crashes or unbounded execution
- Trajectory logging for every run, enabling systematic evaluation and reproducibility
- Evidence-based reporting and cover-letter generation with strict citation guardrails to prevent hallucinations
- Deterministic pipeline and agentic loop paths for comparative analysis and real-world testing

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a reproducible, evidence-based framework for evaluating LLM agents in real-world tasks like job matching, with built-in safety and evaluation metrics critical for RAG and AI stack builders.
