## Summary
Membro is a local-first memory service for AI assistants that ingests conversations, extracts durable facts with deterministic validation, and serves them via an HTTP API and MCP server. It maintains an immutable append-only ledger of facts with provenance tracking, all stored in a single SQLite file on the user's machine.

## Key Features
- Immutable append-only fact ledger with deterministic extraction walls
- Provenance-carrying summaries with per-fact source tracing
- HTTP API and MCP server for recall, search, and memory operations
- Quarantine and review system for untrusted or low-confidence facts
- Local-first architecture with SQLite storage and optional tailnet deployment

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Membro provides a critical foundation for RAG systems by ensuring durable, provenance-backed memory storage with deterministic fact extraction, reducing hallucinations and improving context reliability.
