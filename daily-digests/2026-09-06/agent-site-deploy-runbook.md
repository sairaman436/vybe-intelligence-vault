## Summary
A deployment runbook designed to automate the full delivery loop for AI agents to deploy static websites or PWAs from code edit to live site in under a minute. It includes environment preparation, GitHub repo setup, Netlify hosting, and PWA configuration with minimal manual steps.

## Key Features
- Automates end-to-end deployment from code edit to live site (~1 minute cycle)
- Includes a one-command publish script (`publish.sh`) for version sync and deployment
- Provides PWA support with manifest, service worker, and icon generation (pure Python)
- Only 3 manual steps required (token provisioning, Git integration auth, access control)
- Includes environment probing and sandbox preparation guidance for AI agents

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It streamlines the deployment process for AI agents, reducing manual intervention and enabling rapid iteration for static sites and PWAs in AI-driven workflows.
