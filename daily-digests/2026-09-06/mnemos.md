## Summary
mnemos is a local-first memory server for AI agents that indexes project documentation, notes, and code into a searchable SQLite database. It enables cited retrieval via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing agents like Claude Code to answer questions with precise file and line references from the user's own knowledge base.

## Key Features
- Indexes plain Markdown or any file structure into a local SQLite database with FTS5 full-text search
- Provides cited retrieval via MCP, returning exact file#section and line ranges for verifiable answers
- Supports both lexical (BM25) and optional semantic search (hybrid retrieval with embeddings)
- Enables read-write memory with durable fact capture, task management, and consolidation workflows
- Zero dependencies: single cgo-free Go binary with no external services or databases required

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
mnemos eliminates hallucinations in AI agents by grounding responses in the user's own documented knowledge, ensuring verifiable and project-specific answers without relying on external or vector-based memory systems.
