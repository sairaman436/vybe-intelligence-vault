## Summary
Hacocoon is an open-source secure workspace runtime designed to isolate coding agents and developer tools within disposable environments while maintaining host authority and security. It enables agents to perform tasks like editing, building, and testing without granting privileged access to host credentials or resources.

## Key Features
- Isolated execution environments for coding agents with fail-closed security policies
- Host-controlled resource budgets and workspace leases to prevent overuse
- Loopback-only client access and reusable client adapters for IDE integration
- Pluggable backend architecture supporting Incus and optional OCI tooling
- Comprehensive security model separating long-lived host credentials from disposable environments

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Hacocoon provides a critical security layer for RAG and AI agent systems by ensuring isolated, policy-controlled execution environments that prevent privilege escalation while enabling unrestricted development tasks.
