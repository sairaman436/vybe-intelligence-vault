## Summary
qubes-mcp provides a FastMCP server that enables AI agents to operate within a Qubes OS sandbox, granting controlled access to qube lifecycle management, file transfers, and network operations while enforcing strict tag-based isolation and dom0-mediated trust boundaries.

## Key Features
- Tag-scoped trust boundary using Qubes' `ai-managed` tag to restrict AI agent access to only designated qubes
- dom0-mediated wrappers (`qmcp.*`) enforce invariants and mediate all privileged actions via qrexec
- Multi-stage rollout with reversible installation scripts and comprehensive testing for each stage
- Resource tiering (Stage I) to graduate AI agent authority within the sandbox, preventing destructive operations
- Opaque error handling and existence hiding to prevent leakage of system state or untagged qube existence

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables secure, isolated execution of AI agents within Qubes OS, ensuring strict trust boundaries and preventing unauthorized access to the host system or untagged resources.
