## Summary
LangState is a Python library for compressing long LLM conversations into an inspectable scaffold state while preserving recent turns verbatim. It enables users to validate the survival of critical facts in the compressed state through deterministic receipts.

## Key Features
- Compresses long conversations into a visible scaffold state while retaining system messages and recent turns verbatim
- Provides deterministic receipts to validate the survival of critical facts in the compressed state
- Supports multiple summarization backends (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, or custom)
- Enables inspection, editing, or rejection of compressed state before further use
- Lightweight with no runtime dependencies beyond the standard library

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It ensures critical facts survive context compression in RAG pipelines, enabling auditable and reliable long-term conversation state management.
