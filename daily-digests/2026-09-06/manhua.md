## Summary
A modular, local document-processing pipeline that converts Chinese manhua chapters into natural, readable US English pages. It handles speech bubble detection, OCR, translation, paraphrasing, and rendering while preserving original artwork and ensuring consistency via a shared glossary.

## Key Features
- Seven modular, idempotent pipeline stages (import, detect, OCR, translate, paraphrase, render, QA)
- Pluggable AI backends (Ollama for offline, MCP for interactive workflows)
- Per-series glossary for consistent terminology across chapters
- Defensive text-gated rendering to preserve original artwork integrity
- Batch processing CLI with resume/skip functionality for unattended operation

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a robust, local-first pipeline for transforming foreign-language comics into readable English pages, enabling AI engineers to integrate document processing workflows into RAG systems.
