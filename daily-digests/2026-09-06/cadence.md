## Summary
Cadence is a TypeScript-based developer tool that enforces a DRAFT→BUILD→SETTLE loop to prevent AI agents from marking work as complete without verified acceptance criteria. It acts as a verification layer, re-checking declared criteria and refusing to settle until evidence meets the specified standards.

## Key Features
- DRAFT→BUILD→SETTLE loop enforces rigorous verification of work before marking it complete
- Configurable quality gates re-check acceptance criteria and refuse unverified work
- Supports multiple entry points: CLI, host adapters (Claude Code, Codex), and MCP server
- Offline mock verifier for testing, with optional real AI-based verification (Anthropic, Ollama, etc.)
- Optimistic concurrency control and tool-trust envelopes for secure MCP tool interactions

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Cadence provides a critical control layer for AI-assisted development workflows by ensuring agents cannot self-certify work completion without verified evidence, reducing the risk of unverified or flawed code being marked as done.
