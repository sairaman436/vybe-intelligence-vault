## Summary
SyncGate is a governed MCP gateway that unifies a fleet of devices into a single MCP endpoint, supporting both REST/OpenAPI services (translated to MCP tools) and existing MCP servers (federated). It provides authentication, RBAC, rate limiting, health checks, circuit breaking, and audit trails for mixed fleets.

## Key Features
- Unified MCP endpoint for mixed fleets (REST and MCP upstreams)
- Automatic OpenAPI spec discovery and translation to MCP tools
- Federation of existing MCP servers with governance and security controls
- Per-device authentication, RBAC, rate limiting, and audit trails
- Scalable architecture with stateless gateways and stateful workers

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
SyncGate simplifies RAG/AI stack integration by providing a single governed MCP endpoint for heterogeneous device fleets, ensuring consistent tool access, security, and scalability.
