## Summary
InsurIntellect is an open-source AI agent designed for local insurance policy PDFs, enabling clause-grounded retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with hybrid search (vector + BM25) and strict evidence-based answers. It prioritizes citations over LLM-generated content and refuses off-topic or ungrounded queries.

## Key Features
- Clause-first RAG with hybrid retrieval (vector + BM25) for high-stakes insurance documents
- Strict evidence gating with similarity thresholds and refusal for ungrounded queries
- Citation-tracked answers with document/page/excerpt provenance
- Lightweight, local-first architecture with synthetic sample PDFs for demo purposes
- Honest boundary handling for off-topic, advice, or regulatory-sensitive queries

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a specialized, evidence-first RAG framework for insurance policies, ensuring compliance and accuracy in high-stakes financial document analysis.
