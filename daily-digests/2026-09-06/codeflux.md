## Summary
CodeFlux is a local-first coding agent designed to prioritize correctness and security by deriving authority from explicit actions rather than model assertions. It operates in isolated worktrees, never edits the main checkout, and enforces strict separation of knowledge, ambiguity, and recommendations.

## Key Features
- Derives authority from explicit action identities, not model assertions
- Operates in isolated Git worktrees to prevent direct checkout edits
- Separates knowledge, ambiguity, and recommendations to avoid overconfidence
- Uses SQLite as the sole authoritative store for all runtime state
- Enforces strict separation between frontend (Go/WASM) and backend processes

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
CodeFlux provides a secure, correctness-first approach to coding agents by ensuring actions are explicitly authorized and isolated, reducing risks of unauthorized or erroneous changes in AI-driven development workflows.
