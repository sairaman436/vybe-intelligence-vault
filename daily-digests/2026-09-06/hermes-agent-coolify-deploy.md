## Summary
This repository provides a deployment script to run the Hermes Agent (by NousResearch) on a Coolify-managed VPS, addressing compatibility issues like Docker network mode conflicts and Coolify's Traefik routing. It supports both private (SSH tunnel) and public (Traefik-routed) deployment modes with security best practices.

## Key Features
- Automated deployment of Hermes Agent on Coolify-managed VPS with pre-configured fixes for compatibility issues
- Supports two deployment modes: private (SSH tunnel) and public (Traefik-routed with dual auth layers)
- Handles security best practices like random credential generation, dual authentication, and API key protection
- Addresses upstream/Coolify incompatibilities (e.g., network_mode: host, image pull policies, and Coolify auto-generated env vars)
- Provides end-to-end health checks and connection info output for immediate use

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It simplifies the deployment of Hermes Agent on Coolify by resolving critical compatibility issues, ensuring secure and reliable setup for RAG/AI stack builders.
