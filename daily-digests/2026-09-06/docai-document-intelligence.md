## Summary
A bounded-autonomy agent that dynamically researches and profiles entities (companies or individuals) by iteratively assessing confidence thresholds and hard iteration caps, then synthesizing findings into a structured dossier. It uses web search, retrieval, and LLM-based extraction to build auditable, evidence-backed profiles.

## Key Features
- Bounded-autonomy agent with confidence-based stopping criteria and hard iteration caps
- Dynamic retrieval using TF-IDF + cosine similarity over gathered findings (not fixed store)
- Real-time decision node (`assess_node`) that routes research based on field confidence
- Auditable `decision_log` capturing every step and override (e.g., hard cap enforcement)
- Interactive dashboard for monitoring agent runs and dossier construction

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a robust framework for autonomous, confidence-driven research agents that can dynamically adapt their workflows based on evidence quality, making it essential for building scalable RAG systems that require iterative refinement and auditable decision-making.
