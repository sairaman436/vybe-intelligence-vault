## Summary
An MCP server that enables LLMs to interact with LTspice and ngspice for circuit simulation, schematic editing, and structured data extraction. It bridges LLMs with real-world circuit design tools, allowing assistants to design, simulate, and iterate on circuits while returning measurable metrics like gain, phase margin, and operating-point parameters.

## Key Features
- Direct integration with LTspice and ngspice for simulation and analysis
- Structured extraction of circuit metrics (e.g., gain, phase margin, gm/ID) without rawfile parsing
- Real-time schematic editing (.asc) and netlist manipulation (.cir/.net)
- Support for Monte Carlo sweeps, parameter sweeps, and stability analysis
- Configurable tool profiles for different use cases (e.g., agentic vs. full automation)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables LLMs to autonomously design, simulate, and verify electronic circuits using industry-standard tools, bridging the gap between AI-driven design and real-world engineering workflows.
