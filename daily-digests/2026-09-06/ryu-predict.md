## Summary
Ryu Predict is a Windows-only experimental system-wide predictive-typing companion that provides inline ghost text in any text field, accepted via the Tab key. It acts as a surface layer for the Ryu ecosystem, delegating prediction logic to a core brain while handling caret context, UI rendering, and input injection.

## Key Features
- Inline ghost text rendering in any text field using GDI overlays
- Tab-swallowing keyboard hook for accepting predictions without disrupting normal input
- Caret context detection via UIA TextPattern for accurate prediction input
- Delegates prediction logic to a core brain via HTTP, ensuring no model or policy logic resides in the companion
- Standalone Cargo crate with Windows-first support and planned macOS/Linux compatibility

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a system-wide surface layer for predictive typing in Windows, enabling seamless integration with AI-driven prediction backends while abstracting away platform-specific complexities.
