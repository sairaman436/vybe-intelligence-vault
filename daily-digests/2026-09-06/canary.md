## Summary
Canary is a local MCP server and CLI tool that bridges Interactive Brokers (IBKR) TWS or IB Gateway to provide structured market and account data for AI assistants, terminals, and risk management workflows. It enables read-only access to portfolio analytics, market regime analysis, and trading insights without requiring hosted services or additional runtimes.

## Key Features
- Read-only access to IBKR account data (positions, P&L, Greeks, margin, etc.) via CLI or MCP server
- Real-time market regime analysis (VIX, dealer gamma, breadth, stress testing)
- Local watchlist management with enriched quote monitoring and market-event flags
- Position sizing and risk assessment tools (fixed-fractional sizing, stress testing)
- Integration with AI assistants (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Continue, Zed) via MCP protocol

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Canary provides critical real-time market and portfolio context for RAG systems by exposing structured IBKR data through a local MCP server, enabling AI assistants to perform risk-aware analysis without exposing sensitive account data to external services.
