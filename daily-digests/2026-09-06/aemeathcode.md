## Summary
AemeathCode is a terminal-based AI agent framework that implements a mini Claude Code from scratch using pure Python and asyncio. It provides a ReAct loop, tool execution, memory management, and MCP client integration for building autonomous agents.

## Key Features
- Pure Python asyncio implementation of a ReAct agent with tool execution (file I/O, shell commands, directory listing)
- Multi-process architecture with daemonized backend and TUI frontend for real-time interaction
- Memory management with three-layer scope (single-turn, session, long-term) and automatic context compression
- Built-in permission system for safe tool execution with user approval workflows
- MCP client integration for extending agent capabilities with external tools (e.g., GitHub, file systems)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a transparent, educational implementation of core AI agent mechanics like ReAct loops, tool execution, and memory management, serving as both a functional framework and a learning resource for building autonomous agents.
