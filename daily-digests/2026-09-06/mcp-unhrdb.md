## Summary
mcp-unhrdb is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides read-only access to two UN human-rights corpora: UNHRDB paragraphs and UHRI recommendations. It exposes four tools over stdio or HTTP to enable native querying of these corpora in AI clients like Claude Desktop or Cowork.

## Key Features
- Exposes two distinct UN human-rights corpora (paragraphs and recommendations) as MCP tools without blending data
- Supports both stdio and HTTP transports for local and remote clients
- Provides verbatim, citable results from UN documents with full metadata
- Includes lookup tools for resolving citations and annotation IDs to full records
- Offers faceted search with filters for countries, bodies, themes, and years

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI systems to directly query and cite authoritative UN human-rights documents, ensuring accuracy and traceability in RAG applications.
