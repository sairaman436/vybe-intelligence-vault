## Summary
A local MCP server that wraps Korea's public procurement auction data (나라장터 낙찰정보서비스) Open API, enabling natural language queries for bid results, awards, and bidder rankings through MCP clients.

## Key Features
- Wraps Korea's public procurement auction data API into a local MCP server for natural language queries
- Supports parallel searches across multiple procurement categories (construction, services, goods, foreign procurement)
- Handles date range splitting and partial failures gracefully with error transparency
- Normalizes data.go.kr error codes into actionable Korean messages
- Integrates with major MCP clients (VS Code, Cursor, Claude, etc.) via standardized configuration

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a standardized, natural language interface to Korea's public procurement data, simplifying integration for AI agents and RAG systems requiring real-time bid result insights.
