## Summary
mcp-local-vision enables text-only LLMs to read images and PDFs by delegating vision tasks to a local VLM running on the user's GPU via llama.cpp. It ensures no data leaves the machine and integrates seamlessly with MCP clients like OpenCode and Claude Code.

## Key Features
- Delegates vision tasks to a local VLM without cloud dependency or API keys
- Supports both text-layer and scanned PDF extraction with poppler-utils
- Automatically manages GPU lifecycle (starts/stops llama-server on demand)
- Optimized for verbatim transcription with minimal latency and context usage
- Integrates with MCP clients like OpenCode and Claude Code for seamless AI workflows

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables text-only LLMs to process visual data locally, eliminating cloud dependencies and ensuring data privacy while expanding AI capabilities for RAG pipelines.
