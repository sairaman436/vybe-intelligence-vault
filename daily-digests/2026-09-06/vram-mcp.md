## Summary
vram-mcp is an MCP server that enables AI agents to safely share a single NVIDIA GPU by providing real-time VRAM visibility, cross-session model claims, and protected eviction mechanisms. It integrates with Ollama and uses NVML for GPU utilization tracking, ensuring safe multi-agent coordination on resource-constrained hardware.

## Key Features
- Real-time VRAM visibility across all GPU processes, not just Ollama models
- Cross-session model claims with TTL-based expiration for safe eviction
- Protected eviction mechanisms that prevent unloading claimed or actively computing models
- Per-process GPU utilization tracking via NVML for accurate busy detection
- Audit trail logging for tracking model lifecycles, disappearances, and actions

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables safe multi-agent AI workloads on a single GPU by preventing resource conflicts and providing visibility into VRAM usage, critical for RAG builders managing constrained hardware environments.
