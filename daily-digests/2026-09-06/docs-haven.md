## Summary
DocsHaven is a local knowledge base for AI agents that indexes GitHub repositories, enables instant full-text search, and ensures knowledge persistence across sessions. It operates as an MCP server with 16 tools, requiring minimal dependencies and no cloud services.

## Key Features
- Instant SQLite FTS5 search with BM25 ranking for sub-100ms query times
- URI-based organization (core://, ref://, guide://) for domain-specific knowledge management
- Built-in conflict detection to flag contradictory documents during indexing
- Compressed multi-machine sync via Git for seamless knowledge sharing
- 16 MCP tools for integration with any MCP-compatible AI agent (Claude, Cursor, etc.)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
DocsHaven eliminates the need for AI agents to relearn or forget critical knowledge between sessions by providing a persistent, local, and instantly searchable knowledge base.
