## Summary
An MCP server providing AI assistants with real-time access to Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) public open data, including passenger frequency, live disruptions, infrastructure projects, and platform details without requiring an API key.

## Key Features
- Provides 10 structured tools for querying SBB open datasets (passenger frequency, live disruptions, platform data, etc.)
- Supports both stdio and Streamable HTTP transport modes for MCP clients
- Includes dual output formats: human-readable Markdown and machine-readable JSON with structuredContent
- No API key required; all data is publicly accessible from data.sbb.ch
- Hardened against injection with regex validation and ODSQL escaping

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
This repository enables AI models to directly query real-time and historical Swiss rail data, enhancing RAG systems with accurate, structured transport information without manual API integration.
