## Summary
bbarit-oss is an open-source, terminal-native AI coding agent written in Rust, offering a single static binary that interacts with 15+ LLM providers and 1,000+ models. It enables autonomous code editing, shell execution, semantic code search, and multi-agent orchestration with built-in personas and project wiki support.

## Key Features
- Single static Rust binary with no runtime dependencies, cross-compiling to macOS, Linux, and Windows
- Supports 15+ LLM providers and 1,000+ models with a unified registry, including local models via Ollama
- Autonomous tool-use loop with file editing, shell execution, semantic code search, and parallel sub-agent orchestration
- Built-in project wiki for persistent codebase knowledge and 295 curated personas for domain specialization
- Auto-memory system for cross-session context retention and MCP server interoperability for extensibility

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a lightweight, provider-agnostic, and self-hostable alternative to proprietary AI coding agents, enabling full control over data and infrastructure while supporting advanced features like multi-agent orchestration and semantic code search.
