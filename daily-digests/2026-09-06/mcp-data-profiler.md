## Summary
An MCP server that enables AI agents to understand datasets without reading raw rows by generating compact structured profiles. It analyzes file metadata, column types, ranges, missing values, and data-quality issues for CSV, Parquet, JSON, and Excel files.

## Key Features
- Generates compact structured profiles (100x smaller than raw data) for datasets
- Identifies data-quality issues (nulls, constants, mixed types, date/number storage errors)
- Supports multiple file formats (CSV, Parquet, JSON, Excel)
- Honest sampling with metadata flags for sampled vs. full data
- Path safety with root directory confinement and symlink protection

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It drastically reduces context costs for RAG systems by providing essential dataset metadata instead of raw rows, enabling more efficient and accurate AI-driven data analysis.
