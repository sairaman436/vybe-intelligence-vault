## Summary
Custodian is an autonomous operations monitoring and auto-repair plugin for Hermes Agent, designed to detect, classify, and repair agent platform failures during quiet hours by monitoring gateway logs, cron jobs, skill journals, and OCAS data directories.

## Key Features
- Lifecycle hooks for session management (post_tool_call, on_session_start, etc.)
- Built-in tools for status checks, scanning, and issue management (custodian_status, custodian_scan, custodian_issues)
- Slash commands for real-time operations (/custodian status, /custodian scan, /custodian repair)
- Tiered failure response with escalation for low-confidence issues
- OCAS data directory and skill journal monitoring

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Custodian ensures agent platform reliability by autonomously detecting and repairing failures, reducing downtime and manual intervention for RAG/AI stack builders.
