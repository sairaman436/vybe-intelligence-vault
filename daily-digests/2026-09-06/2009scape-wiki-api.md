## Summary
This repository transforms raw game data from 2009scape into an immutable SQLite knowledge base, serving it via a FastAPI HTTP endpoint and an MCP server for AI agents like Claude. It enables structured querying of game entities, relationships, and attributes for wiki or agent-based applications.

## Key Features
- Converts raw game sources into a single immutable SQLite artifact for efficient querying
- Provides both HTTP (FastAPI) and MCP server interfaces for AI agents and wiki frontends
- Implements token-based authentication with rate limiting and banning for security
- Supports offline builds from source with versioned datasets hosted on Hugging Face
- Includes a modular architecture with clear separation of domain, pipeline, repository, and surface layers

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a structured, queryable knowledge base for game data that can be leveraged by AI agents or wiki systems, enabling accurate and efficient retrieval of game entities and relationships.
