## Summary
Momus is an AI-powered code-review agent for GitHub pull requests that investigates the entire repository before drafting findings, ensuring only well-supported comments reach the PR. It uses an adversarial verification pass to filter out noise, optimizing for recall while maintaining precision through structured, evidence-based reviews.

## Key Features
- Two-stage review process: coverage-first reviewer followed by adversarial verifier to filter findings
- Repository-wide investigation using read-only tools (read_file, search, list_dir) to contextualize diffs
- Structured output with citations, severity ratings, and confidence levels for every finding
- Planted-bug evaluation harness to measure precision, recall, and cost per review
- Idempotent re-runs with content-addressed markers to avoid duplicate comments

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Momus reduces noise in AI-driven code reviews by ensuring only high-confidence, evidence-backed findings are posted, making it essential for teams seeking reliable automated code quality checks.
