## Summary
Agent Letterbox for Zellij is a coordination layer that enables durable, inspectable task handoffs between AI coding agents running in Zellij panes. It ensures work is tracked as persistent 'letters' on disk while optionally providing live terminal notifications (doorbells) to wake agents.

## Key Features
- Durable task handoffs stored as Markdown letters on disk, preserving context and history
- Optional live terminal notifications (doorbells) to wake agents in Zellij panes
- Explicit ACK/NACK/RESULT lifecycle for task ownership and progress tracking
- Addressable doorbells with 8-hex tokens for targeted agent wake-ups
- Cross-terminal compatibility with the Agent Letterbox protocol family

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a reliable, inspectable way to coordinate multiple AI agents in Zellij without losing task context or requiring human relay work.
