## Summary
Anvil is a Rust-based Agent Client Protocol (ACP) server that provides a reusable agent engine for ACP-compatible clients like editors, bots, TUIs, and internal tools. It handles model routing, tool loops, permissions, sessions, and MCP integration while delegating user experience to the client.

## Key Features
- Portable ACP server supporting multiple clients (Zed, JetBrains, Neovim, custom TUIs)
- Built-in model routing for 10+ providers (OpenAI, Bedrock, Ollama, DeepSeek, etc.)
- Explicit safety boundaries with permission gates, workspace checks, and configurable sandboxing
- Persistent sessions with durable history, context compaction, and usage reporting
- Direct ACP client installers and extensible tooling (filesystem, shell, MCP servers, plugins)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Anvil provides a standardized, reusable agent runtime that simplifies building and integrating AI agents across multiple frontends while ensuring safety and scalability.
