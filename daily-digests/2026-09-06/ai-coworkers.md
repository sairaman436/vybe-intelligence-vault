## Summary
ai-coworkers is a long-running AI daemon that executes predefined roles with strict boundaries, acting as a persistent AI coworker rather than a chat interface. It performs jobs autonomously based on markdown-defined roles, escalating to humans only when necessary, and integrates with existing AI tools and MCP servers.

## Key Features
- Role definitions via markdown files (no YAML or code changes required)
- Six-tier memory system (working, episodic, semantic, entity, procedural, reflective) with local SQLite storage
- Strict boundaries enforced via BOUNDARIES.md, with dry-run mode for safety
- Adaptive tick loop that minimizes model calls by skipping quiet periods
- Integration with existing AI tools (MCP servers, Hermes, OpenClaw, Vercel Eve, ACP agents)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a robust, boundary-enforced framework for deploying persistent AI agents that perform jobs autonomously while minimizing unnecessary model calls and ensuring human oversight.
