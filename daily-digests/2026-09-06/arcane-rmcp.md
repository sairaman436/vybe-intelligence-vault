## Summary
arcane-rmcp is a Rust-based MCP server and CLI that bridges Arcane API with Docker management, enabling agents to interact with Docker environments, containers, images, networks, volumes, and Arcane resources through MCP tools or direct shell commands.

## Key Features
- Exposes MCP tools for Docker and Arcane resource management (containers, images, networks, volumes, etc.)
- Supports stdio and HTTP MCP protocols with configurable authentication (bearer tokens, OAuth, loopback dev mode)
- CLI parity with MCP tooling for scripting and debugging
- Enforces destructive-operation confirmations and action scopes for safety
- Integrates with Arcane API for GitOps, vulnerability scanning, and system operations

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a secure and standardized way for AI agents to manage Docker and Arcane resources via MCP, bridging infrastructure operations with AI workflows.
