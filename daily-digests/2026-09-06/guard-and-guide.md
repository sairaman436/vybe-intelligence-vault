## Summary
guard-and-guide is a security tool designed to intercept and block dangerous operations performed by AI coding agents while providing clear guidance on safer alternatives. It acts as a middleware between the agent and system operations, enforcing customizable rules to prevent unintended actions.

## Key Features
- Blocks dangerous operations (e.g., git push, .env file access) based on customizable rules
- Provides clear, actionable feedback to agents on why an operation was blocked and what to do instead
- Supports multiple AI coding agents (Claude Code, Gemini CLI) with agent-specific tool mapping
- Lightweight and fast, designed to integrate seamlessly into existing workflows
- Uses regex patterns for flexible rule definition and canonical tool names for consistency

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It prevents AI agents from executing harmful operations by enforcing safety rules, reducing security risks in automated coding environments.
