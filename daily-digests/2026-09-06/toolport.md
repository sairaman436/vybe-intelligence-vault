## Summary
Toolport is a local MCP gateway that consolidates multiple MCP servers into a single, shared port, reducing token overhead and simplifying configuration for AI clients. It enables lazy tool discovery, security checks, and centralized management of tools across all connected AI tools.

## Key Features
- Lazy tool discovery reduces token overhead by up to 98% per request by advertising only compact meta-tools instead of full tool catalogs.
- Centralized management of MCP servers with one-time setup, shared across all AI clients (Claude, Cursor, VS Code, etc.).
- Security features including tool integrity checks, anti-rug-pull detection, human-in-the-loop approvals, and content defense against prompt injection.
- Per-client scoping and governance with agent rules applied uniformly across all connected clients.
- Built-in diagnostics, playground for testing tools, and support for routines to save and reuse multi-step workflows.

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Toolport is essential for RAG/AI stack builders because it drastically reduces token costs and simplifies MCP server management, enabling seamless integration across multiple AI clients while enforcing security and governance.
