## Summary
CodeImpact MCP is a fast pre-commit dependency gate for AI-assisted code changes, providing PASS/WARN/BLOCK verdicts to assess the safety of commits by analyzing dependency graphs. It operates locally without databases or heavy infrastructure, focusing on blast-radius triage for multi-file edits.

## Key Features
- Fast PASS/WARN/BLOCK verdicts for commit safety checks
- Lightweight in-memory dependency graph with no database
- Supports TypeScript/JavaScript (full graph) and Python (limited)
- Pre-commit hook integration for automated gate checks
- Risk scoring (0-1) and affected file summaries

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a critical safety gate for AI-generated code changes by quickly assessing dependency risks before commits, reducing the likelihood of breaking changes in production.
