## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that wraps the upstream mcp-atlassian toolset with browser-cookie authentication via Playwright, enabling access to Atlassian Server/Data Center instances behind corporate SSO where API tokens are unavailable.

## Key Features
- Browser-cookie authentication for Atlassian instances behind corporate SSO
- Separate authentication and server processes to avoid blocking tool calls
- Supports seeding automation profiles from real browser sessions for seamless SSO login
- Monkey-patches upstream mcp-atlassian clients to inject browser-cookie sessions
- CLI and MCP server dual-mode for scripting and agent integration

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables RAG builders to securely access Atlassian data behind SSO without API tokens, bridging a critical gap in enterprise AI integrations.
