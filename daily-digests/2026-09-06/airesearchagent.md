## Summary
A scaffold for an event-driven research-assistant backend designed to eventually power a multi-agent pipeline that researches topics and generates briefings. The current implementation provides infrastructure plumbing (FastAPI, Kafka, vector DB client stubs) without active agent logic or LLM integration.

## Key Features
- FastAPI-based REST API with health check and `/ingest` endpoint
- Async Kafka producer/consumer skeletons for event-driven processing
- Pluggable vector DB client interface (stub implementation)
- Dockerized deployment for containerized runs
- Environment variable configuration for Kafka and vector DB

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a foundational infrastructure skeleton for building event-driven AI research agents, enabling scalable event processing and vector storage integration for RAG pipelines.
