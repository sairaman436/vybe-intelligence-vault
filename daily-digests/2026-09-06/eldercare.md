## Summary
ElderCare is an AI companion assistant designed for elderly individuals living alone, offering conversational support, health consultations, psychological counseling, emergency medical advice, and fraud prevention. It uses a dynamic routing RAG system with a three-stage retrieval pipeline to ensure high-quality, explainable responses with clickable source citations.

## Key Features
- Dynamic routing RAG with 5 intent categories (chat, health, psychology, emergency, fraud) and risk assessment
- Three-stage retrieval pipeline (dense + sparse → RRF → CrossEncoder rerank) for high-quality context
- Clickable source citations with chunk-level traceability and historical session replay
- Real-time email alerts for high-risk scenarios with async task dispatch
- Built-in evaluation framework (LLM-as-judge) for RAG performance benchmarking

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
ElderCare demonstrates a production-grade RAG system with dynamic intent routing, multi-stage retrieval, and explainable outputs, making it a critical reference for AI engineers building robust, user-trusted agent frameworks.
