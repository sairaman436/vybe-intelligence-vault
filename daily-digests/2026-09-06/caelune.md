## Summary
Caelune is a local-first Windows desktop application and read-only MCP server designed for searching private Markdown, PDF, and Tika-backed knowledge bases. It combines hybrid retrieval (lexical, semantic, and optional reranking) with a user-friendly interface for indexing, querying, and reviewing results.

## Key Features
- Hybrid retrieval combining lexical (FTS5), semantic (LanceDB), and optional reranking for high-accuracy search
- Local-first architecture with privacy-focused design, keeping all data and indexes on the user's machine
- Read-only MCP server for seamless integration with AI clients while preventing index modifications
- Event-driven live watch for automatic incremental updates to knowledge bases after file changes
- Support for Markdown, PDF, and 1,290+ file formats via Apache Tika with unified source-aware results

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Caelune enables RAG builders to securely and efficiently search private knowledge bases with hybrid retrieval while ensuring data privacy and seamless MCP integration for AI clients.
