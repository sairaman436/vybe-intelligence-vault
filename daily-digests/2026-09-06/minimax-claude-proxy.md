## Summary
MiniMax-Claude-Proxy is a local proxy that enables MiniMax-M3 to fully integrate with the Claude Code framework by backfilling six Anthropic-specific protocol features that are otherwise unsupported. It acts as a transparent intermediary, ensuring compatibility without modifying the client or upstream API.

## Key Features
- Implements 6 Anthropic-specific features (Prompt Caching, Extended Thinking, complex tool_use schema, multi-modal support, SSE stability, server-side tools) locally to ensure seamless Claude Code integration with MiniMax-M3
- SQLite-based prefix caching with usage placeholder injection, reducing token usage and latency by up to 217x on cache hits
- Transparent schema flattening and restoration for tool_use parameters, enabling complex nested structures to work correctly
- Multi-modal preprocessing for images and PDFs, converting them into compatible formats for Claude Code
- SSE stabilizer with heartbeat ping and buffered tool_use chunks to prevent long-task interruptions

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI engineers to seamlessly integrate MiniMax-M3 with Claude Code by resolving critical protocol incompatibilities, ensuring full functionality without modifying the client or upstream API.
