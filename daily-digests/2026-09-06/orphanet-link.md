## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides structured access to Orphanet's rare-disease knowledge via a normalized SQLite + FTS5 index, enabling efficient querying of disease nomenclature, gene associations, phenotypes, and cross-references without manual XML parsing.

## Key Features
- Prebuilt SQLite index with FTS5 for fast full-text search over disease names and synonyms
- Comprehensive toolset for resolving diseases by labels, ORPHA codes, or external CURIEs (OMIM, MONDO, ICD-10/11, etc.)
- Batch processing capabilities for disease resolution and retrieval
- Precomputed classification hierarchies (parents/children/ancestors/descendants) for efficient traversal
- Integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP) for seamless AI agent interactions

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a critical, structured interface to rare-disease knowledge, enabling AI systems to efficiently ground queries in authoritative biomedical data without manual XML parsing or complex joins.
