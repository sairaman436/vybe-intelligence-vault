## Summary
rousseau-agent is a self-hosted, container-native coding agent designed for teams that require on-premises or air-gapped environments. It supports nine chat transports, five LLM providers, and integrates with MCP servers, cron schedulers, and skills loaders while enforcing strict supply-chain security standards.

## Key Features
- Supports nine chat transports (WhatsApp, Slack, Discord, Email, etc.) and five LLM providers (Claude CLI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex, OpenAI-compatible).
- Runs as a rootless Podman container with SLSA-3 provenance, cosign-signed releases, and CycloneDX SBOM for enterprise-grade security.
- Includes an MCP server for integration with IDEs and other agents, a cron scheduler for automated tasks, and a skills loader for extensibility.
- Features a TUI client, session store with SQLite, and approval policies for controlled tool execution.
- Designed for air-gapped environments with no telemetry, no SaaS control plane, and minimal outbound traffic.

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables secure, self-hosted AI coding assistance with enterprise-grade supply-chain controls, making it ideal for teams with strict data sovereignty requirements.
