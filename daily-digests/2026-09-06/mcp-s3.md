## Summary
mcp-s3 is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants to interact with Amazon S3 and S3-compatible object storage systems. It provides secure, configurable access for browsing buckets, reading/writing objects, and generating presigned URLs, bridging AI assistants with storage infrastructure.

## Key Features
- Supports AWS S3 and S3-compatible storage (SeaweedFS, LocalStack)
- Secure by default with read-only mode, size limits, and prefix-based ACLs
- Multi-account/region support with dynamic connection management
- Library-first design for custom MCP server integration
- Audit logging and middleware/interceptor patterns for enterprise requirements

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a secure, standardized way for AI assistants to interact with object storage, enabling seamless data access and management for RAG pipelines.
