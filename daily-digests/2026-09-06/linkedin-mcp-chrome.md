## Summary
A defensive wrapper around the upstream `mcp-server-linkedin` package that pins `fastmcp<4.0` to prevent crashes from FastMCP 4.0 API changes. It provides a Chromium-based auth flow for LinkedIn integration with Claude Desktop, ensuring seamless and persistent LinkedIn tool access without manual dependency management.

## Key Features
- Defensive wrapper to prevent FastMCP 4.0 API breakage by pinning `fastmcp<4.0`
- Chromium-based auth flow with persistent session storage in `~/.linkedin-mcp/profile/`
- Zero runtime behavior changes—inherits all 17 LinkedIn tools from upstream
- Seamless integration with Claude Desktop via `uvx linkedin-mcp-chrome`
- Automated setup and troubleshooting guidance for local development

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It ensures stable, crash-free LinkedIn MCP tool access for AI agents by preventing upstream dependency breakage, reducing manual configuration overhead for developers.
