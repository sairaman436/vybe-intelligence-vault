## Summary
Agentpack provides local-first task continuity for AI coding agents by maintaining a durable task state ledger in the repository. It enables seamless session resumption across different agents or clients without rebuilding context from scratch.

## Key Features
- Local-first task state ledger stored in `.agentpack/` for reviewability and privacy
- MCP server and CLI tools for seamless agent session resumption and state recording
- Task Passport lifecycle with explicit start, park, switch, and finalize states
- Task gate to prevent scope drift and enforce write boundaries
- Zero telemetry, zero network calls, and minimal dependencies for security

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Agentpack ensures AI coding agents retain critical task context across sessions, reducing redundant work and improving continuity for long-running or collaborative tasks.
