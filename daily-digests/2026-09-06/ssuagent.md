## Summary
ssuAgent is a LangGraph-based multi-agent system designed to connect to the 숭실대학교 MCP server (ssuMCP) for campus AI services. It routes user queries to domain-specific agents (academic, library, LMS) and streams responses via SSE, enabling real-time interactions in the ssuAI web UI.

## Key Features
- Multi-agent orchestration with LangGraph StateGraph for explicit state management and branching
- Fallback LLM provider chain (Groq → Gemini → OpenRouter) with runtime key validation
- PostgreSQL-based checkpointing for conversation state persistence and thread ownership binding
- Domain-specific agents (academic, library, LMS) with tool binding fallbacks for provider resilience
- SSE streaming endpoints for real-time agent responses in web UI

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a robust, production-ready multi-agent framework for campus AI services with explicit state management, fallback LLM providers, and secure thread ownership binding, critical for scalable RAG deployments.
