## Summary
Delta Harness is a lightweight TypeScript-on-Bun binary designed to build long-running AI agents with MCP tools, managed context, subagents, and self-improvement capabilities. It operates as a single-binary daemon with minimal dependencies and supports durable state management via SQLite.

## Key Features
- Single-binary deployment with zero runtime dependencies (~30MB RSS, <50ms cold start)
- Durable run queue with SQLite-based checkpointing and crash recovery
- Built-in MCP client with streamable HTTP/stdio support and tool discovery
- Self-learning agent memory via atomic writes to `DELTA.md` for continuous improvement
- OpenAI-Responses-compatible API with async task handling and observability endpoints

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Delta Harness provides a lean, self-contained framework for building production-grade long-running AI agents with MCP integration, making it essential for developers seeking scalable and durable agent architectures.
