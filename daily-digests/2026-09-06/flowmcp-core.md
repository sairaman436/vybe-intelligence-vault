## Summary
FlowMCP Core is a framework for converting existing REST APIs into standardized Model Context Protocol (MCP) interfaces, enabling AI systems to access APIs in a structured, testable, and semantically consistent way. It provides a v4 pipeline with 16 orchestrated steps for validation, security scanning, and tool generation.

## Key Features
- v4 Pipeline with 16-step orchestration for schema processing, validation, and tool generation
- Built-in security scanning for forbidden patterns (eval, imports) before module loading
- Automated schema quality grading via GradeReporter with A–F scoring
- Placeholder resolution for 12 types against a typed catalog (tools, resources, prompts, etc.)
- Skills-only special path for schemas with empty tools, optimizing pipeline execution

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
FlowMCP Core enables AI systems to reliably and consistently interact with REST APIs through a standardized MCP interface, reducing integration complexity and improving semantic consistency for RAG pipelines.
