## Summary
Selvedge is an MCP server that captures live reasoning from AI coding agents (e.g., Claude Code, Cursor) as they make changes, providing long-term memory for AI-coded codebases. It stores structured change events with context in a local SQLite database, enabling queries like 'why was this change made?' even months later.

## Key Features
- Captures agent reasoning live during changes, not inferred post-hoc
- Entity-level granularity (e.g., DB columns, env vars) instead of line-level
- Local SQLite storage with zero external dependencies
- Supports Agent Trace format for interoperability with other tools
- Enforces prior_attempts checks to prevent repeated mistakes

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Selvedge preserves the critical 'why' behind AI-generated changes, enabling audits, debugging, and knowledge retention in AI-coded codebases where traditional commit messages and context are often lost.
