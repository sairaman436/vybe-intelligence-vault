## Summary
AXTerminator is an MCP server that enables AI agents to interact with and control macOS applications via the Accessibility API. It provides low-latency, semantic-based GUI automation tools for background interaction, audio capture, camera input, and virtual desktop management.

## Key Features
- 34+ MCP tools for GUI interaction, observation, verification, system control, audio capture, and camera input
- Sub-millisecond element access (~379µs) via AX semantic tree for reliable and fast automation
- AX-first with vision fallback for canvas apps, games, and surfaces lacking Accessibility API support
- Background interaction without visible cursor movement, enabling seamless multi-app automation
- Integration with popular AI clients (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code Copilot) via MCP protocol

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides AI agents with a high-performance, semantic-based alternative to vision-first GUI automation for macOS, reducing latency, cost, and reliability issues while enabling background-safe interactions.
