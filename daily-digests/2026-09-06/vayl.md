## Summary
Vayl is a reconciling memory layer for AI agents that supersedes stale facts with current ones, supports explicit removals, and maintains auditable history. It integrates via the MCP protocol and provides tools for memory management, safety, compliance, and team administration.

## Key Features
- Reconciles memory by superseding stale facts with current ones, ensuring unambiguous truth at read time.
- Supports explicit removals (e.g., 'we dropped X') that retract facts from active memory while preserving history.
- Maintains a tamper-evident, signed audit chain for all changes, enabling time-travel queries and accountability.
- Integrates seamlessly with MCP clients (Claude, Cursor, etc.) and frameworks (LangGraph, LangChain, CrewAI) via dedicated SDKs.
- Offers 30+ MCP tools for memory operations, safety checks, compliance, and team administration with low operational cost.

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Vayl eliminates the critical flaw of additive memory layers—stale facts—by ensuring agents always retrieve current, reconciled information, making it essential for reliable RAG and agentic systems.
