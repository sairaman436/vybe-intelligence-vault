## Summary
Paparats-MCP is a local-first Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that semantically indexes entire code repositories, enabling AI coding assistants to understand and navigate codebases with AST-aware chunking, symbol graphs, and architectural memory. It provides real-time, private, and token-efficient code search and context for agents like Claude Code and Cursor.

## Key Features
- Semantic, AST-aware code indexing across 11 languages with cross-chunk symbol graphs (calls, references, etc.)
- Architectural memory system for agents to maintain and reuse components, decisions, and lessons learned
- 100% local and private deployment with Qdrant and local embeddings (no cloud or API keys required)
- Real-time sync and token-efficient context retrieval with Prometheus metrics and observability
- Multi-repository workspace support with Git history per chunk and rich metadata

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Paparats-MCP enables AI agents to deeply understand and navigate entire codebases with semantic precision, reducing context bloat and improving accuracy in RAG and agentic workflows.
