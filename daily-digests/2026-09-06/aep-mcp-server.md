## Summary
An open-source MCP server for Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) that provides 46 tools across 12 categories, enabling full read and write operations including batch ingestion, schema composition, audience activation, privacy jobs, and datastreams. It complements Adobe's read-only first-party MCP tools by offering the missing write path and broader functionality.

## Key Features
- 46 tools across 12 categories with full CRUD operations (read + write)
- Self-hosted, Apache 2.0 licensed, no invitation required for access
- Supports batch ingestion, schema composition, audience activation, privacy jobs, and datastreams
- OAuth Server-to-Server authentication with token caching and automatic re-authentication
- Structured error handling with `AEP_{status}` codes and safety gates for irreversible operations

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It bridges the critical gap in Adobe's read-only MCP tools by enabling full write operations for AI agents, making it essential for RAG builders who need to interact programmatically with Adobe Experience Platform.
