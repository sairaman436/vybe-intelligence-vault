## Summary
A dynamic LLM routing layer that intelligently selects the best model per request based on task type, provider health, and cost constraints. It acts as a single OpenAI-compatible API gateway for multiple LLM providers like Claude, GPT, Llama, and DeepSeek.

## Key Features
- Task classification via keyword and heuristic rules (code, writing, reasoning, cheap)
- Provider health monitoring with automatic cooldown on failures (429/5xx errors)
- Ordered fallback chain to ensure no request fails due to a dead provider
- Cost-aware routing with bulk tasks directed to free/cheap tiers and complex tasks to premium models
- Config-driven provider registry via YAML for easy extensibility

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It simplifies multi-model LLM integration by dynamically routing requests to optimize for quality, latency, and cost, making it essential for scalable RAG systems.
