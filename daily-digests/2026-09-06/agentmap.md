## Summary
agentmap is a compiler-grade TypeScript/JavaScript repository mapping tool that helps coding agents efficiently locate relevant code files with 98%+ token savings compared to traditional methods like grep. It resolves TypeScript paths, aliases, and monorepo workspaces to provide accurate dependency and symbol resolution.

## Key Features
- Compiler-grade TypeScript/JavaScript resolution with ts-morph, supporting tsconfig paths, vite/webpack aliases, and monorepo workspaces
- 98%+ token savings for agents by replacing brute-force file dumps with ranked, queryable dependency graphs
- Self-refreshing map via post-commit hooks and agent-loop wiring to prevent stale data and encourage tool usage
- Published accuracy evaluations (EVAL.md) demonstrating 100% precision in dependency and symbol resolution vs. grep's ~60%
- Zero network calls, no vector DB, and no API keys required; fully local and privacy-preserving

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It drastically reduces token waste and improves accuracy for RAG/AI agents by providing compiler-grade dependency resolution, ensuring agents query the right files without bloating context.
