## Summary
A local Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for scientific paper research that integrates OpenAlex, CrossRef, and Unpaywall APIs to provide search, metadata, abstracts, and legal Open Access PDF downloads entirely on your machine. Designed for privacy-conscious users and MCP clients like Claude Desktop or Cursor.

## Key Features
- Integrates three open scholarly APIs (OpenAlex, CrossRef, Unpaywall) into five LLM-callable tools for paper research
- Provides legal Open Access PDF downloads with SSRF-safe, magic-byte-verified, and atomic file handling
- Reconstructs abstracts from OpenAlex's inverted index for lossless retrieval
- Supports privacy mode via `POLITE_POOL=0` to withhold contact email from API requests
- Offers offline testing with 69 mocked tests and optional live API smoke tests

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
This MCP server simplifies RAG pipelines by providing a local, privacy-conscious interface to fetch and process scientific papers with legal Open Access PDFs, reducing dependency on paywalled or unethical sources.
