## Summary
OpenClaw Secure Deployment provides a zero-trust Docker-based sandbox for running OpenClaw agents with enforced isolation, preventing host system access even if the agent misbehaves. It leverages read-only filesystems, capability dropping, and a mediated Docker socket proxy to minimize attack surfaces.

## Key Features
- Read-only root filesystem to prevent host modifications
- Dropped Linux capabilities and blocked privilege escalation
- Mediated Docker socket proxy restricting dangerous API calls
- Isolated internal network and restricted writable scope to a single directory
- Pre-configured for LMStudio and OpenClaw with easy customization

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a critical security layer for running autonomous AI agents in isolated environments, reducing blast radius from compromised or misbehaving agents.
