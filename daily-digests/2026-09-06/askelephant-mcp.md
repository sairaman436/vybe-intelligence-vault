## Summary
A Cloudflare Worker that provides a hosted MCP server for querying AskElephant call transcripts via claude.ai. It acts as a read-only intermediary, fetching and filtering transcripts to reduce token costs for AI models.

## Key Features
- Hosted MCP server for claude.ai compatibility
- Read-only access to AskElephant transcripts
- Efficient transcript filtering to minimize token usage
- Cloudflare KV cache for 90-day transcript retention
- Cloudflare Access OIDC authentication with PKCE

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables hosted MCP connectivity for AskElephant, allowing AI models to query transcripts without exceeding context window limits or requiring local server setup.
