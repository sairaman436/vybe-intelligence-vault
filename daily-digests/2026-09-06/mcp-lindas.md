## Summary
mcp-lindas is an MCP server that exposes Switzerland's 44 political Linked Data cubes (e.g., votes, elections, federal council) via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI systems. It provides 8 tools to query and retrieve structured political data while preserving source attribution and ensuring data integrity.

## Key Features
- Exposes 44 Swiss political data cubes via MCP with 8 specialized tools for querying (e.g., votes, elections, federal council records).
- Preserves data provenance: every response includes the exact source IRI, row, or version for traceability.
- Supports offline testing via recorded fixtures and live mode with polite rate limiting (2 requests/sec, burst 4).
- No data storage or state retention; operates purely as a read-only interface to LINDAS.
- Comprehensive testing pipeline with 64 tests (22 unit, 7 contract, 35 end-to-end) and rule-based contract validation.

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a standardized, provenance-aware interface to high-quality Swiss political data, essential for RAG systems requiring authoritative and traceable sources.
