## Summary
XAF Logic Explainer is a Roslyn-based tool that extracts and documents the custom logic of DevExpress XAF applications, enabling AI coding agents to understand application-specific entities, controllers, business rules, and Model Editor customizations without requiring compilation or DevExpress assemblies.

## Key Features
- Roslyn-based extraction of XAF entities, controllers, actions, and business rules without compilation
- Supports both XPO and EF Core ORMs with auto-detection
- Generates tiered documentation (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md) for AI agents with minimal context overhead
- Provides an MCP server for live querying of application logic during development
- Includes incremental change detection and diff reporting to track modifications

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to accurately understand and interact with custom XAF applications by extracting application-specific logic that is invisible to general-purpose AI tools.
