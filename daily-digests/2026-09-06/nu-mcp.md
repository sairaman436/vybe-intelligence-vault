## Summary
nu-mcp is an MCP server that exposes Nushell as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server using Rust, enabling persistent shell execution with state preservation and extensible tooling for AI agents and automation workflows.

## Key Features
- Persistent Nushell shell with state preservation (environment variables, aliases, definitions)
- Extensible tool system via modular Nushell scripts (Kubernetes, ArgoCD, Tmux, Context7, etc.)
- Configurable timeouts and path validation for secure command execution
- Two-tool architecture: stateless `run` and stateful `shell` for concurrent and persistent execution
- Safety sandbox with intelligent path handling and destructive operation warnings

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to execute and manage Nushell commands persistently with state, while providing a secure and extensible tooling system for integrating with infrastructure and development workflows.
