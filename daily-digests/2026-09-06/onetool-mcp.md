## Summary
OneTool-MCP is a single, unified MCP server that consolidates 240+ tools into one API, eliminating the token overhead and context rot associated with multiple MCP servers. It enables developers to write Python code to execute tools directly, reducing token usage by 96% and lowering costs by 30x.

## Key Features
- Consolidates 240+ tools into a single MCP server, reducing token overhead by 96%
- Supports explicit tool execution via Python API (e.g., `__onetool brave.search(query='AI')`)
- Includes built-in packs for web search, databases, file operations, diagrams, and image vision
- Provides MCP server proxy functionality to wrap existing MCP servers without tool tax
- Offers smart context storage (SQLite+FTS5) and encrypted secrets management

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
OneTool-MCP drastically reduces token usage and costs for AI agents by consolidating multiple MCP servers into a single, efficient interface, making it essential for scalable RAG and AI stack deployments.
