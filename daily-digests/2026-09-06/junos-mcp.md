## Summary
MCP server for Juniper JUNOS devices that exposes device operations, configuration management, upgrades, diagnostics, and safety-checked changes to AI assistants via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It acts as an AI-facing interface to the junos-ops CLI toolkit.

## Key Features
- Exposes Juniper device operations (show commands, config management, upgrades) via MCP for AI assistants like Claude Desktop/Code
- Safety-first design with dry-run defaults, commit confirmed with auto-rollback, and health checks for destructive operations
- Parallel batch operations for diagnostics, upgrades, and command execution across multiple devices with tag-based filtering
- Structured output support (JSON/XML) for CLI commands and server-side output filtering to reduce payload size
- Connection pooling for efficient NETCONF session reuse and configurable idle timeouts for security compliance

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI assistants to safely and efficiently interact with Juniper JUNOS devices for network operations, reducing manual CLI work and improving automation in RAG pipelines.
