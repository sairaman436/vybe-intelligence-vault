## Summary
An MCP server that enables AI agents to analyze packet capture (pcap) files by running a version-pinned tshark inside a secure container. It mounts captures read-only and returns concise results inline while handling large outputs via JSONL files, allowing agents to iteratively investigate GB-scale captures without drowning in data.

## Key Features
- Runs tshark in a version-pinned, isolated container with dropped capabilities and no network access for security and reproducibility
- Mounts pcap files read-only to preserve original data integrity and avoid copying large files
- Returns small results inline and writes large outputs as JSONL files for efficient agent interaction
- Provides 12 MCP tools for packet analysis, including workspace management, protocol hierarchy, conversation tracking, and object extraction
- Handles untrusted captures by defanging extracted objects, wrapping stream content in nonce-tagged markers, and logging payload-free operations

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to safely and efficiently analyze large-scale network captures without overwhelming responses, bridging the gap between raw packet data and actionable insights for security and forensic investigations.
