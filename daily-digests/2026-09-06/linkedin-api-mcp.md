## Key Features
- Provides 14 tools for reading LinkedIn data (profiles, companies, jobs, messages) and limited write actions (messages, connection requests)
- Uses a real browser session with authenticated cookies for reliable access
- Enforces rate limiting via a queue system to prevent account restrictions
- Supports secure credential storage in OS keyring or environment variables
- Designed for seamless integration with AI agents via MCP protocol

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to safely and securely interact with LinkedIn data and perform limited actions, bridging the gap between AI automation and real-world social media integration.
