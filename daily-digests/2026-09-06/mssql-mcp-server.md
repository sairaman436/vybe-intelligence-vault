## Summary
A .NET 8 MCP server that exposes read-only MSSQL Server tools to AI hosts like Cursor and Claude Desktop via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It enables AI agents to interact with SQL Server databases for metadata exploration and query execution.

## Key Features
- Exposes read-only MSSQL Server tools via MCP for AI hosts
- Supports metadata operations (tables, views, procedures, functions, triggers)
- Provides validated SELECT-only query execution
- Offers search and reference-finding capabilities for database objects
- Configurable via JSON settings with local overrides for security

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to securely interact with SQL Server databases for metadata retrieval and read-only queries, enhancing RAG pipelines with dynamic data access.
