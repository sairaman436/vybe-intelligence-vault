## Summary
A Python-based MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that connects AI assistants to Microsoft's Patch Tuesday security updates via the MSRC CVRF API. It enables natural-language queries over CVEs, KBs, severity ratings, and exploitation status, enriching data with EPSS scores and CISA KEV catalog information.

## Key Features
- Natural-language queries over Microsoft Patch Tuesday releases, CVEs, and KBs
- Enrichment with EPSS scores and CISA KEV catalog status for prioritization
- Filtering by product, severity, exploitation status, and CVSS metrics
- Batch KB lookup for installed-update lists and supersedence chain resolution
- Exportable triage briefings in Markdown or CSV format for executive summaries

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides AI assistants with direct, structured access to Microsoft's authoritative Patch Tuesday data, enabling precise, context-aware security triage without manual portal navigation.
