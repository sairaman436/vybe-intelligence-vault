## Summary
UnionAir is an experimental Unity Editor plugin that exposes Unity's internal state and operations as a local REST API, enabling AI assistants, development bots, and CI tooling to interact with Unity projects programmatically without direct file system manipulation.

## Key Features
- Exposes Unity Editor state (e.g., scene hierarchy, compilation results, profiler data) via a local REST API
- Supports write operations like asset manipulation, scene editing, and play mode control with Unity's validation rules
- Project-local configuration via `settings.json` for secure and reviewable API exposure controls
- Automatic port allocation with persistent endpoint publishing for reliable client integration
- Modular API categories (e.g., Scene Write, Asset Write, Play Mode) with granular enable/disable controls

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
UnionAir bridges Unity's internal state and operations to external AI agents or tooling, enabling seamless integration for automated workflows, testing, and development without manual file edits.
