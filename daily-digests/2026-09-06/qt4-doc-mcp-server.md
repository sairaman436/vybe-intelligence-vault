## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides offline access to Qt documentation (Qt 4.8, Qt 5, or Qt 6) for AI coding assistants. It enables full-text search, fragment extraction, and Markdown conversion of Qt documentation for local or agent-based use.

## Key Features
- Offline-first access to Qt documentation with full-text search (SQLite FTS5)
- MCP-compliant server for integration with AI assistants (Claude, VS Code, etc.)
- Smart caching and fragment extraction for targeted documentation retrieval
- Supports Qt 4.8, Qt 5, and Qt 6 with automatic docset detection
- Configurable via .env for deployment flexibility and performance tuning

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI coding assistants to access and query Qt documentation locally, reducing dependency on online resources and improving response accuracy for Qt-related queries.
