## Summary
peage-mcp is an MCP server that equips AI agents with a prepaid fiat wallet for pay-per-call API interactions via the peage rail. It enables agents to autonomously handle microtransactions without subscriptions or crypto, with spending caps controlled by the user.

## Key Features
- Provides a prepaid fiat wallet for MCP-capable agents to make API calls with per-call payments
- Supports spending caps and adjustable limits to control exposure
- Integrates Stripe Checkout for human-funded top-ups, minimizing manual intervention
- Includes tools for wallet setup, status checks, receipt verification, and ledger auditing
- Delivers a single static binary (120 KB) with no runtime dependencies (Node/Python)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to autonomously handle microtransactions for API calls, reducing friction in RAG pipelines by eliminating manual payment steps and subscriptions.
