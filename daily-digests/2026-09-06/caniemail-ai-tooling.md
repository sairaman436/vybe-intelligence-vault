## Summary
A Claude skill and MCP server providing AI agents with accurate email client HTML/CSS compatibility data from caniemail.com. It enables agents to lint, check, and search email markup for client-specific rendering issues before sending.

## Key Features
- Three specialized tools for email compatibility: `lint_email`, `check_feature_support`, and `search_features` to avoid overwhelming agent context
- Accurate four-verdict system (supported, unsupported, mitigated, untested) for precise rendering guidance
- Offline-capable with bundled dataset snapshots and live-fetch fallback for data freshness
- Feature detection and parsing implemented from scratch to avoid upstream package defects and limitations
- Supports multiple deployment modes: local skill, MCP server over stdio/HTTP, and direct CLI usage

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to generate email markup that renders correctly across diverse clients, reducing broken emails and improving reliability for automated communication workflows.
