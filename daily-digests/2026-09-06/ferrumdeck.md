## Summary
FerrumDeck is a deterministic Rust-based enforcement plane for AI agents that blocks tool calls in-process, enforcing deny-by-default policies, budget limits, and runtime inspections before agent actions execute. It provides an immutable audit trail and integrates with OpenTelemetry for real-time governance and observability.

## Key Features
- In-process tool call enforcement with sub-millisecond latency (183-503 ns per decision)
- Deny-by-default tool allowlists and per-run budget enforcement to prevent unsafe actions
- Runtime inspection (Airlock RASP) and coherence-divergence detection for mid-run validation
- Immutable, tamper-evident audit trail with cryptographic hash-chaining for compliance
- Integration with OpenTelemetry GenAI spans for unified governance and observability

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
FerrumDeck provides critical in-process enforcement for AI agents, preventing unsafe tool calls and budget overruns before they occur, which is essential for building secure and compliant RAG/AI systems.
