## Summary
Szumrak is an autonomous agent engine that integrates with the Claude Agent SDK to perform tasks on a target repository, commit changes, and open a reviewed pull request. It emphasizes safety with env-validated configuration, bounded execution, and hardened git operations.

## Key Features
- Runs Claude Agent SDK against a target repository to perform tasks autonomously
- Env-validated configuration with Zod and T3 Env to prevent bad inputs early
- Bounded execution with MAX_TURNS and MAX_DURATION_MS to prevent runaway agents
- DRY_RUN mode for safety, allowing inspection of changes before committing or pushing
- Command-injection-hardened git operations using execFileSync with argument arrays

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Szumrak enables AI-driven autonomous code modifications and PR creation, streamlining workflows for AI engineering teams by automating repetitive tasks while ensuring safety and reliability.
