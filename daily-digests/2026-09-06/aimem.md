## Summary
aimem is a local-first MCP (Model Context Protocol) memory server designed to provide persistent, project-scoped memory for AI coding assistants like Claude Code and Cursor. It eliminates the need to re-explain project context across chat sessions by storing memories locally in a SQLite database with vector search capabilities.

## Key Features
- Project-scoped memory storage in a local SQLite database with vector search for efficient retrieval
- Three-tier memory capture: event-based, turn-count based, and context-threshold based to ensure critical information is preserved
- Conflict resolution and versioning engine to handle updates without silent overwrites, preserving historical context
- Zero external dependencies—bundled embedding model and no cloud API or account required
- MCP-compatible tooling for seamless integration with AI coding assistants like Claude Code and Cursor

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
aimem solves the critical problem of AI memory loss in long coding sessions by providing persistent, project-scoped memory that eliminates the need to re-explain context, making it essential for RAG builders who require reliable, local, and efficient memory management.
