## Summary
mcp-agent-server is an MCP-compatible server that integrates AI agent loops with FlowMCP schemas, enabling dynamic tool execution via LLM-powered agents. It supports both MCP and A2A protocols, allowing seamless integration with external APIs and agent-to-agent communication.

## Key Features
- MCP Server with StreamableHTTP transport and session-based interactions
- LLM Agent Loop with iterative tool calling via Anthropic SDK and OpenRouter
- Support for FlowMCP schemas as tool sources (in-process, no external server required)
- Optional A2A Adapter for agent-to-agent communication and discovery
- Configurable agent system prompts, models, and execution limits per tool

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It bridges MCP clients with dynamic AI agent loops, enabling RAG systems to leverage external APIs and tools through standardized protocols while maintaining flexibility in agent configuration.
