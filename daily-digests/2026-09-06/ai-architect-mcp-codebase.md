## Summary
A cross-platform Rust MCP server providing codebase intelligence for AI coding assistants like Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor. It indexes multi-language codebases into a property graph, resolves call chains, detects communities, and exposes 26 tools for hybrid search, impact analysis, and validation without modifying code.

## Key Features
- Indexes 11 languages (Rust, Python, TypeScript, Java, Kotlin, Swift, Objective-C, C, C++, Go, Ruby) into a property graph with community detection via Leiden algorithm
- Hybrid search combining BM25, sparse TF-IDF, and RRF fusion for precise codebase queries
- Provides 26 MCP tools including `analyze_codebase`, `search_codebase`, `get_context`, `get_impact`, and `validate_prd_against_graph` for comprehensive codebase understanding
- Supports cross-platform integration with AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, VS Code, Zed) via MCP protocol
- Includes automated installation, configuration, and idempotent setup for MCP hosts with optional fail-open hooks for enhanced workflows

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides essential, read-only codebase intelligence that eliminates hallucinations and enables accurate RAG pipelines by resolving structural dependencies and impact analysis across multi-language codebases.
