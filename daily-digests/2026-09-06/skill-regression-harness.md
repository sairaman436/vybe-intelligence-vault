## Summary
A regression testing harness for Claude AI skills that validates static correctness and real-world dispatch behavior to detect silent failures in skill routing, authentication, and prompt matching. It combines static analysis with live CLI testing under controlled tool permissions.

## Key Features
- Static layer (Layer 0) for deterministic checks of skill metadata, frontmatter, and coverage gaps
- Live dispatch layer (Layer 1) testing real prompts against installed skills without executing side effects
- Preflight authentication checks to catch OAuth session expiry silently returning success
- Coverage validation to ensure new skills don't silently reduce test coverage
- Baseline recording and comparison to detect description drift without unnecessary re-runs

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It prevents silent failures in AI skill routing that can go undetected for months, ensuring reliable prompt dispatch in production environments.
