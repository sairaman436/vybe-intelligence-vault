## Summary
licita-agent is an agent-native procurement intelligence API focused on the Spanish public sector, specifically IT/software/cybersecurity tenders. It provides structured, provenance-backed data from TED (Tenders Electronic Daily) and PLACSP feeds, enabling autonomous agents to discover, query, and pay for procurement data via REST or MCP interfaces.

## Key Features
- Agent-native discovery via `/llms.txt`, `/openapi.json`, and `/mcp` endpoints
- Provenance-backed data with source URLs and references for every record
- Pay-per-call model with x402 (USDC on Base) or dev faucet for testing
- Autonomous ingestion from TED and PLACSP feeds with idempotent updates
- Forecast signals for contract renewals and re-tendering likelihood

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides structured, provenance-backed procurement data essential for RAG systems to answer complex queries about public sector tenders and contracts in the Spanish market.
