## Summary
A read-only Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes Microsoft 365 service health and Message Center posts via the Microsoft Graph Service Communications API. It enables AI agents to interact with M365 service status and communications using delegated authentication.

## Key Features
- Read-only access to M365 service health and Message Center posts via Microsoft Graph API
- Delegated authentication (browser sign-in/device code) with zero-setup defaults using Microsoft Graph PowerShell client
- Three MCP tools: list_service_health, list_message_center_posts, get_message_center_post
- Zero-setup mode with no app registration required (uses well-known public client)
- Demo mode for testing MCP protocol without tenant authentication

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides AI agents with real-time access to M365 service health and communications, enabling proactive issue detection and automated responses in enterprise environments.
