## Summary
Ru BizGen is a Kotlin-based tool for generating realistic Russian and international test data, available as both an IntelliJ IDEA plugin and an MCP server. It enables local generation of structured data like bank details, legal IDs, personal information, and addresses without external dependencies.

## Key Features
- Local generation of realistic test data (banking, legal, personal, geo) without external API calls
- Available as both an IntelliJ IDEA plugin and an MCP server for AI agent integration
- Supports batch generation (up to 1000 values per call) via MCP tools
- High-performance generation with microsecond latency (benchmarked via JMH)
- Docker-ready with streamable HTTP transport for MCP compatibility

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Ru BizGen provides a critical local alternative for generating realistic test data, reducing dependency on external services and enabling seamless integration with AI agents and development workflows.
