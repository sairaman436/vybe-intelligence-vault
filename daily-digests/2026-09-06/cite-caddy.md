## Summary
Cite Caddy is a standalone remote MCP server that provides full read/write access to Zotero libraries, enabling AI assistants to manage citations, collections, tags, and attachments programmatically. It bridges Zotero's Web API with MCP clients for dynamic library interactions.

## Key Features
- Full CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) for Zotero libraries, including destructive actions like delete and move with explicit safety warnings
- 36 tools covering items, collections, tags, notes, attachments, and schema lookups, with version-aware operations to prevent concurrent edits
- OAuth 2.1 self-service authentication flow for multi-tenant access, enabling dynamic registration of Zotero libraries without admin approval
- Dockerized deployment with optional HTTP mode for remote multi-tenant use or stdio mode for local single-user setups
- Comprehensive testing framework using in-memory fakes to validate Zotero API interactions without live dependencies

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Cite Caddy enables AI assistants to programmatically manage and enrich Zotero libraries, bridging the gap between reference management and AI-driven workflows for RAG systems.
