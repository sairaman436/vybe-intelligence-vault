## Summary
Editor-only Unreal Engine plugin that exports `.uasset` packages to human-readable text via a commandlet, enabling inspection of Blueprint, State Tree, and other asset contents without opening the editor UI. Uses Unreal's native text-export pipeline with noise reduction for cleaner output.

## Key Features
- Exports `.uasset` packages to structured, human-readable text via Unreal's native `UExporter` pipeline
- Removes redundant/cosmetic noise (e.g., `SKEL_*` classes, default pin properties, GUID aliases) for cleaner output
- Provides distinct exit codes for detailed failure analysis (e.g., missing asset, partial export)
- Integrates with Unreal's commandlet system for scripted automation
- Ships with a ready-made Claude Code skill for agent-driven usage

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents and developers to programmatically inspect Unreal Engine assets without editor UI access, facilitating automated analysis, debugging, and RAG pipeline integration for game development workflows.
