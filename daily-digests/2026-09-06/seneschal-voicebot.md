## Summary
Seneschal is an open-source, voice-first AI assistant built in Rust for macOS, enabling real-time voice interaction with natural conversation flow, proactive assistance, and computer automation. It acts as a voice-first interface for delegating tasks to external AI agents.

## Key Features
- Real-time voice interaction with natural conversation flow and barge-in support
- Pluggable STT/TTS systems (Whisper, Parakeet, SFSpeechRecognizer, AVSpeechSynthesizer, Kokoro)
- Persistent conversation history with SQLite and context consolidation
- Plugin system for dynamic tool integration and runtime plugin switching
- HTTP Control API + SSE for external management and integration

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Seneschal provides a voice-first interface to delegate tasks to external AI agents, bridging the gap between real-time voice interaction and complex agentic workflows for RAG/AI stack builders.
