## Summary
A Rust-based MCP server providing persistent memory infrastructure for AI coding agents, featuring PostgreSQL storage with optional vector retrieval, hierarchical summaries, and hybrid search capabilities for efficient observation storage and retrieval.

## Key Features
- PostgreSQL-backed persistent memory with pgvector for vector retrieval
- Hybrid search combining full-text, keyword, and semantic retrieval paths
- Hierarchical summaries with drill-down capabilities for efficient context retrieval
- MCP, HTTP, and CLI entrypoints with shared PostgreSQL service layer
- Privacy filtering and circuit-breaker mechanisms for robust operation

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a robust, PostgreSQL-backed memory infrastructure for AI agents, enabling persistent context storage, hybrid retrieval, and hierarchical summarization essential for RAG systems.
