## Summary
mcp-vst-sidechain is a generic MCP bridge that hosts VST3/AU plugins and exposes their parameters to AI agents in realtime. It enables agents to enumerate, read, set, and save plugin parameters via a single MCP endpoint without requiring source code access to proprietary plugins.

## Key Features
- Hosts any VST3/AU plugin via standard APIs without redistributing binaries
- Exposes plugin parameters to AI agents via MCP for realtime control
- Supports GCF encoding for efficient serialization of large parameter sets (50-92% smaller than JSON)
- Provides tools for enumerating, reading, setting, and saving plugin states
- Cross-platform (macOS, Windows, Linux) with JUCE-based hosting

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a critical bridge for AI agents to directly control and automate proprietary audio plugins in realtime, enabling conversational audio production workflows without requiring DAW integration.
