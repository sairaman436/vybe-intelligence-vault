## Summary
Captain Memo is a local-first, cross-AI memory layer for coding agents that enables shared, persistent, and searchable logs across multiple AI tools (e.g., Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI) using a hybrid vector and keyword search system. It captures session observations, auto-injects context, and coordinates work to prevent overlapping edits.

## Key Features
- Shared local corpus across multiple AI coding agents (Claude, Codex, Gemini CLI, etc.) via MCP server
- Hybrid search combining Voyage embeddings and SQLite FTS5 keyword indexing with recency-aware re-ranking
- Auto-injected context for every prompt using `<memory-context>` envelopes
- Session observations captured and summarized into structured, searchable chunks for future sessions
- Work-coordination board to flag overlapping file edits across AI tools

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Captain Memo eliminates the need to re-explain context across AI sessions by maintaining a persistent, shared memory layer that improves continuity and efficiency for AI-driven coding workflows.
