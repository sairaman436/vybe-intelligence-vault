## Summary
An MCP server and CLI toolkit for zero-instrumentation performance diagnostics of .NET 10 applications, enabling LLM-driven or human-driven triage of runtime issues like threadpool starvation, GC pressure, and memory leaks via diagnostic IPC.

## Key Features
- Zero-instrumentation diagnostics via diagnostic IPC (no code changes required)
- Unified MCP server and standalone CLI with identical diagnostic engine
- 16+ tools for triage, sampling, heap analysis, and event collection (GC, CPU, exceptions, etc.)
- IoT-style triage with auto-generated verdicts, severity scores, and actionable hints
- Cross-platform support (Linux, Windows) with containerized deployments and Kubernetes sidecar

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI-driven or human-driven performance diagnostics for .NET applications without code changes, streamlining root cause analysis for RAG builders integrating runtime insights.
