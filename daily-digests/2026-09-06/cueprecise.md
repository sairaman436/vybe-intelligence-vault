## Summary
CuePrecise is a local MCP server that enables AI agents like Claude to analyze YouTube videos with precision, returning exact timestamps, transcript evidence, and relevant frames. It merges Gemini transcription with YouTube captions to handle code-switching and visual information, storing all analysis locally for reuse across conversations.

## Key Features
- Combines Gemini transcription with YouTube captions to recover lost or misinterpreted terms (e.g., English technical terms in multilingual speech)
- Returns exact timestamps, transcript evidence, and relevant video frames for precise answers
- Stores all analysis locally for reuse across future conversations without external dependencies
- Supports multiple AI clients (Claude, Codex, VS Code, etc.) via MCP integration
- Handles visual evidence beyond captions, improving accuracy for technical or multilingual content

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
CuePrecise is essential for RAG builders because it provides precise, timestamped evidence from YouTube videos, enabling AI agents to ground responses in verifiable sources while preserving context across conversations.
