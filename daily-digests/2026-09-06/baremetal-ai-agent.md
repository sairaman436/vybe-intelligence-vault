## Summary
A minimalist Python framework-free agent runtime that demonstrates raw LLM API calls, tool-use loops, and inspectable agent behavior without relying on abstractions like LangChain or CrewAI. It focuses on transparency, safety, and educational value for understanding agent internals.

## Key Features
- Framework-free agent loop with explicit tool-use schema and raw API calls
- Inspectable by default with payload logging, trajectory export, and offline replay
- Safety features like path traversal protection, secret redaction, and confirmation gates for dangerous tools
- Minimalist design with only 3 core files defining the agent logic (agent.py, tools.py, client.py)
- Deterministic eval harness and streaming support for advanced use cases

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a clear, minimal reference implementation of an agent loop and tool-use system, making it ideal for learning, debugging, and building custom agent frameworks without abstraction overhead.
