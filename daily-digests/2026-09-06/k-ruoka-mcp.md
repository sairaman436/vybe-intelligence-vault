## Summary
An MCP server that enables AI assistants to interact with K-Ruoka's (Finnish grocery) shopping cart via a real Chrome browser, allowing read/write operations like adding items, updating quantities, and clearing the cart without exposing user credentials.

## Key Features
- Interacts with K-Ruoka's private API via a real Chrome browser to manage shopping carts
- Supports read/write operations: search products/stores, add/remove/update items, clear cart
- Uses Docker and PyPI for easy deployment (no Rust toolchain required for users)
- Implements rate limiting to mimic human-like behavior and avoid detection
- Provides authentication via browser cookies without storing user credentials

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI assistants to programmatically interact with K-Ruoka's shopping cart, bridging the gap between AI automation and real-world grocery management for Finnish users.
