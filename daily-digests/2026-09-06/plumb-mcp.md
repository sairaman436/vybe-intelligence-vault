## Summary
Plumb is a bidirectional Figma MCP server that enables two-way workflows: extracting compact design specs from Figma files for AI coding agents and generating on-brand Figma designs from text prompts. It includes verification tools to ensure generated code matches the original design.

## Key Features
- Bidirectional Figma ↔ AI workflow with verification tools (`plumb_verify`, `plumb_fit`) to ensure pixel-perfect alignment between design and code.
- Prompt-to-design generation with a self-critiquing director loop that iterates designs based on agent feedback without requiring external model keys.
- Compact Plumb Design Spec (PDS) output reduces token usage by 99% compared to raw Figma API JSON, making it ideal for coding agents.
- No REST rate limits or metered tool-call quotas when using the Figma plugin path, supporting all plans including Free.
- Multi-agent support allows multiple AI sessions to collaborate on the same Figma file simultaneously.

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Plumb bridges the gap between AI-driven design and development by providing verified, token-efficient Figma integration, enabling seamless design-to-code and prompt-to-design workflows for RAG/AI stack builders.
