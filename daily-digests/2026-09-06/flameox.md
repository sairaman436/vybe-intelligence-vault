## Summary
flameox provides runtime evidence collection and profiling for agents to trace, profile, and analyze performance hotspots in application/native code, GPU kernels, and inference stacks. It integrates with tools like pyperf, py-spy, and torch.profiler to generate reproducible diagnostics for investigations.

## Key Features
- Integrates multiple profilers (pyperf, py-spy, torch.profiler) into a unified evidence layer
- Preserves original artifacts with workload, environment, and outcome metadata
- Supports named workloads and experiments for reproducible comparisons
- Provides CLI and MCP interfaces for agent integration
- Records failed attempts and incomplete evidence for transparency

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
flameox enables AI agents to collect and analyze runtime evidence systematically, ensuring reproducible diagnostics for performance investigations and comparisons.
