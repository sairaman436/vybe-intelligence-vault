## Summary
agentcikit provides CI-grade evidence and safety tools for AI agents, MCP servers, and open-source contributions, enabling reproducible debugging, context extraction, and security validation through five focused command-line utilities.

## Key Features
- Turns CI failure logs into reproducible repro plans and PR evidence packs with `ci-repro`
- Extracts minimal, explainable context for agent tasks using `patch-context`
- Validates MCP server contracts and detects secret leaks via `mcp-gate`
- Records and replays MCP JSON-RPC traffic for debugging with `mcp-replay`
- Runs deterministic safety regression tests for agent tool calls with `tool-fence`

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides essential CI-grade tools to validate, debug, and secure AI agents and MCP servers, reducing noise and improving reproducibility in RAG and agentic systems.
