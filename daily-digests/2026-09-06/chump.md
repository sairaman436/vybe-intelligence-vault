## Summary
Chump is a self-hosted multi-agent fleet coordinator and gap registry designed for AI coding agents. It enables concurrent agent sessions on the same repository without conflicts, offering both a coordinator layer for external agents and an optional built-in agent with local LLM support, persistent memory, and 30+ governed tools.

## Key Features
- File-based leases and SQLite gap registry for concurrent agent session management without conflicts
- Built-in agent with local-first inference (Ollama, vLLM, mistral.rs), persistent SQLite memory, and 30+ governed tools
- Linked worktrees and merge-queue ship pipeline for isolated, conflict-free code changes and automated PRs
- Ambient.jsonl peripheral vision stream for real-time visibility into agent activities and system state
- Supports external agents (Claude Code, opencode, Aider, etc.) via a pure coordinator mode

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Chump provides a critical orchestration layer for scaling AI coding agents while ensuring conflict-free collaboration, making it essential for building robust, multi-agent RAG systems.
