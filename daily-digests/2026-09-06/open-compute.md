## Summary
open-compute is a lightweight, model-agnostic Python core for building computer-use agents that automate GUI, desktop, and browser tasks. It provides a unified agent loop (perception → reasoning → action → feedback) with swappable backends, normalized coordinates, and a central safety gate, enabling seamless integration with models like Anthropic Claude and OpenAI CUA.

## Key Features
- Unified agent loop with perception, reasoning, action, and feedback stages
- Backend abstraction layer supporting Claude, OpenAI CUA, and mock backends
- Normalized coordinate system (0..1) with backend-specific denormalization
- Centralized safety gate for risk mitigation (confirmation, allow/deny lists)
- Hybrid perception interface (screenshots, accessibility, DOM) for semantic targeting

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a standardized, model-agnostic foundation for building computer-use agents, enabling RAG builders to integrate GUI automation seamlessly with minimal vendor lock-in.
