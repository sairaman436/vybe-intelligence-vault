## Summary
unifi-rmcp is a Rust-based MCP server and CLI for managing Ubiquiti UniFi Network controllers through official, internal, and hybrid API actions. It exposes MCP tools and a CLI to inspect clients, devices, networks, health, and more, while enforcing UniFi permission scopes.

## Key Features
- Exposes UniFi controller data via MCP tools and CLI for agent interactions
- Supports both official and internal UniFi API actions with permission enforcement
- Provides HTTP MCP server for shared deployments and loopback stdio for local use
- Includes CLI parity for debugging and scripting, with Docker and npm packaging
- Enforces UniFi read/admin scopes and integrates with OAuth for HTTP MCP auth

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It bridges UniFi network data with AI agents via MCP, enabling secure, permission-aware access to network telemetry and controls for RAG applications.
