## Summary
PiLink is an OAuth-protected MCP server that exposes a local coding agent harness over Streamable HTTP and legacy SSE, enabling trusted administrators to authorize remote MCP clients like ChatGPT to interact with a development machine securely.

## Key Features
- OAuth-protected MCP server with dynamic client registration and token management
- Secure execution environment with configurable restrictions (e.g., file access, shell commands, and Git operations)
- Support for both Cloudflare Quick Tunnel and direct HTTPS hosting via Caddy
- Detailed audit logging for MCP tool calls with bounded storage and failure isolation
- Agent chat coordination tool for multi-agent collaboration with structured message history

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
PiLink enables secure, remote-controlled access to local development environments for AI agents, bridging the gap between cloud-based AI and on-premise coding tools while enforcing strict security and audit controls.
