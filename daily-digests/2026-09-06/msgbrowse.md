## Summary
msgbrowse is a self-hosted, local-only browser and search engine for personal message archives (Signal, iMessage, WhatsApp) that provides a private UI, keyword and semantic search, and an MCP server for AI-powered querying over your message history.

## Key Features
- Local-only processing with no data egress beyond configured LLM endpoints
- Supports Signal, iMessage, and WhatsApp archives via upstream exporters
- Keyword and semantic search with embeddings for natural language queries
- MCP server for integration with AI assistants like Claude
- Incremental and idempotent imports with incremental updates

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables private, local-first RAG over personal message archives with seamless AI assistant integration via MCP, ensuring data never leaves the user's control.
