## Summary
Reapfield is a web scraping tool that converts URLs and plain-language field specifications into structured JSON output, including pages rendered via JavaScript. It intelligently derives CSS selectors using an LLM once per field per domain, caches them for future use, and avoids unnecessary LLM calls by replaying cached selectors until they fail validation.

## Key Features
- Derives CSS selectors using an LLM once per field per domain, then caches them for deterministic replay
- Supports JavaScript-rendered pages via Playwright
- Configurable field types (e.g., float, bool, int) with inline annotations
- Respects robots.txt and implements rate limiting for ethical scraping
- Provides both CLI and MCP server interfaces for integration with AI agents

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Reapfield reduces the cost and complexity of web scraping for RAG pipelines by automating selector derivation and caching, ensuring reliable and repeatable data extraction without constant LLM calls.
