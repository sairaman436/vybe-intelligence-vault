## Summary
Clawd Cursor is a local MCP server that enables AI agents to safely control desktop applications by compiling the screen into a stable UI map using accessibility trees and OCR, acting on elements by ID rather than pixels. It verifies actions and routes all operations through a single safety checkpoint.

## Key Features
- Compiles screen into a stable UI map using accessibility trees and OCR, reducing reliance on expensive vision models
- Acts on elements by stable IDs instead of pixel coordinates, ensuring reliability across screen resizes and DPI changes
- Verifies every action by re-checking the live screen and reporting deviations if the UI did not respond as expected
- Routes all operations through a single safety checkpoint (allow/confirm/block) to prevent unauthorized or unsafe actions
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux) with local-only execution for privacy and performance

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a safe, efficient, and verifiable way for AI agents to interact with native desktop applications, bridging the gap between AI automation and real-world GUI control without relying on cloud-based vision models.
