## Summary
gaz-mcp is an MCP server that exposes read-only MySQL/PostgreSQL database access, Jenkins administration with configuration history, and live Go process diagnostics (pprof/expvar) as standardized tools for AI agents. It uses stdio transport for seamless integration with MCP clients and includes a reusable diagnostics Go module for service-side instrumentation.

## Key Features
- Read-only SQL access with dynamic database selection and enforcement
- 33 Jenkins tools including configuration history with SQLite-based snapshots
- Live Go process diagnostics via pprof/expvar with optional SQL pool metrics
- Structured JSON output designed for programmatic AI agent consumption
- Hexagonal architecture for modularity and maintainability

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides AI agents with standardized, read-only access to critical infrastructure like databases, CI/CD systems, and runtime diagnostics, enabling safer and more effective tool use in RAG pipelines.
