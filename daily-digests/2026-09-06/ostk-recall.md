## Summary
A local-first, single-binary search-and-recall service that indexes personal files, chat histories, and code into a private corpus. It combines hybrid semantic and keyword retrieval with a concept ledger and attention runtime, exposing results via MCP to clients like Claude Desktop or Cursor while keeping all data on-device.

## Key Features
- Hybrid dense (model2vec) and sparse (BM25) retrieval with reciprocal rank fusion and optional cross-encoder reranking
- Concept ledger with typed nodes, directed edges, and conductance-based graph diffusion for dynamic memory
- Live attention runtime with auto-weaving, decay, and ambient memory lens for contextual recall
- 31 MCP tools spanning recall, memory, attention, and thread management for AI agent integration
- Pre-built binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows with zero-config deployment

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a privacy-preserving, local-first alternative to cloud-based RAG systems, enabling AI agents to perform hybrid semantic and keyword search across personal data while maintaining full control over the corpus and retrieval process.
