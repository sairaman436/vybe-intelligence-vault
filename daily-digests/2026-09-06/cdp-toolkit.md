## Summary
A lightweight MCP-compatible toolkit that drives specific Chrome tabs via the DevTools Protocol with bounded timeouts and no fan-out overhead. It avoids agent wedging by targeting one tab per call, supports network mocking, and enables multi-agent tab leasing for shared browser sessions.

## Key Features
- One-target-per-call architecture with bounded timeouts to prevent agent wedging
- Network mocking for UI testing without backend dependencies
- Tab leasing for multi-agent collaboration on a single browser
- Lazy CDP domain enabling to avoid known hangs like eager Network.enable
- Stateless element references and secret handling for credential injection

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a reliable, low-overhead way to drive specific Chrome tabs for AI agents without risking agent hangs or requiring Puppeteer, making it essential for RAG builders who need robust browser automation.
