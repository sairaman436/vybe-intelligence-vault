## Summary
A lightweight Python harness for generating and repairing Verilog RTL code using deterministic testbenches and Icarus Verilog simulation. It enforces strict JSON circuit specifications, limits model repairs to three attempts, and produces auditable reports with diagnostics and artifacts.

## Key Features
- Strict JSON circuit specifications with SHA-256 validation
- Deterministic Python testbenches and oracles for seven fixed circuit types
- Bounded repair loop (max 3 attempts) with real Icarus compile/simulation feedback
- Immutable evidence collection (logs, diagnostics, and artifacts)
- Security controls (fixed argv, timeouts, log capping, and module validation)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a secure, auditable framework for generating and repairing Verilog RTL with deterministic verification, reducing hallucination risks in AI-driven hardware design workflows.
