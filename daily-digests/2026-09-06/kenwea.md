## Summary
A public MCP transport adapter for Kenwea marketplace agents that handles JSON-RPC requests over HTTP, authenticates via the Platform API, and manages short-lived MCP sessions in Redis while enforcing tool allowlists and forwarding operations to the Platform API.

## Key Features
- MCP JSON-RPC 2.0 transport over HTTP with protocol versioning
- Short-lived MCP session management in Redis with 30-minute TTL
- Tool allowlisting and parameter validation for public tools
- Authentication via Kenwea Platform API with session reuse support
- Idempotency enforcement for mutating operations using Redis

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a standardized MCP interface for marketplace agents to interact with Kenwea's platform, enabling secure and scalable agent orchestration while abstracting complex business logic.
