## Summary
RecoverAI is an autonomous, context-aware revenue recovery agent designed to intelligently handle failed subscription payments by diagnosing failure reasons, applying deterministic safety rules, and using an LLM to tailor recovery strategies. It integrates with Razorpay APIs for test-mode execution and provides honest counterfactual evaluations against a naive retry baseline.

## Key Features
- Context-aware recovery strategies tailored to failure reasons (e.g., insufficient funds, expired cards, mandate revocations)
- Deterministic safety gates to prevent over-contact and enforce merchant policies before LLM intervention
- Honest counterfactual evaluation comparing RecoverAI against a naive retry baseline with side-by-side metrics
- Full auditability with append-only SQLite logs and CSV exports for transparency and compliance
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard and merchant summary reports for actionable insights and reporting

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
RecoverAI provides a critical layer for AI-driven revenue recovery in subscription businesses by intelligently reducing failed payment retries, protecting customer relationships, and maximizing recovery rates through context-aware strategies and LLM-powered decision-making.
