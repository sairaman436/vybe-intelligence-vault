## Summary
core-memory-kit enables persistent, per-project memory for AI agents like Claude Code, Kiro, Cursor, and Codex by capturing decisions, preferences, and context in plain markdown files committed to the project's git repository. It automatically injects this memory at session start and recalls facts by meaning using local semantic search.

## Key Features
- Persistent per-project memory stored in plain markdown committed to git, ensuring context travels with the codebase.
- Automatic capture of decisions and preferences without manual prompts, with background LLM processing.
- Local semantic search (R@5 0.941) for recall by meaning, eliminating reliance on exact keyword matches.
- Privacy-preserving design with automated PII redaction and deterministic screening before commits.
- Cross-agent compatibility (Claude Code, Kiro, Cursor, Codex) and per-project memory isolation.

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It solves the critical problem of AI agents forgetting context between sessions by providing persistent, git-committed memory that enhances continuity and reduces redundant explanations for RAG and AI stack builders.
