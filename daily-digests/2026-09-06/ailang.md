## Summary
AILang is an AI-native systems programming language designed to bridge the gap between human-readable code and machine-verifiable semantics. It compiles to native binaries via LLVM and generates structured metadata (`.ailmeta`) to enable AI agents to understand code intent, effects, and constraints with compiler-level trust.

## Key Features
- Generates structured `.ailmeta` files with compiler-verified semantics for AI agents to consume
- Combines Rust-level safety with Python-like simplicity and C/Go-style syntax
- Explicit ownership and borrow system with inferred lifetimes for memory safety
- Supports AI-first constructs like `agent`/`tool` declarations with auto-generated OpenAI Tool Schema
- Designed for AI legibility with semantic types, effects, and errors derived from return types

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
AILang enables AI systems to trust and directly utilize compiler-verified code semantics, reducing ambiguity in code understanding and enabling safer, more reliable AI-driven development workflows.
