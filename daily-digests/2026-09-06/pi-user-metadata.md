## Summary
A pi extension that injects a Claude-Code-shaped `metadata.user_id` into Anthropic Messages API requests, enabling proper user identification for gateways and proxies that rely on this field for routing or rate-limiting.

## Key Features
- Injects `metadata.user_id` into Anthropic Messages API requests
- Generates stable `device_id` based on hostname and username
- Supports configurable `providers`, `deviceId`, and `accountUuid`
- Non-intrusive: only modifies payloads with `messages` array and does not overwrite existing `metadata.user_id`
- Handles errors gracefully without breaking requests

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It ensures proper user attribution in API requests for gateways and proxies that rely on `metadata.user_id`, preventing misrouting or rate-limiting issues in RAG and AI pipelines.
