## Summary
Sentinel is a secure, auditable agentic system administration tool written in Rust that implements an Investigate → Plan → Approve → Act workflow. It uses a deny-by-default policy engine, operator approval gates, and hash-chained audit logs to safely execute LLM-driven system tasks.

## Key Features
- Deny-by-default policy engine with kill switch and resource guards
- Operator approval gate for all mutating actions
- Hash-chained SHA-256 audit log with tamper detection
- 14 built-in capabilities (filesystem, process, packages, network, metrics)
- Pluggable LLM backends (Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama) and fleet mode with mTLS

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Sentinel provides a critical safety layer for AI-driven system administration by enforcing strict approval workflows and tamper-proof audit trails, reducing operational risks in agentic environments.
