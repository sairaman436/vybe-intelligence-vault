## Summary
A collection of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers providing structured, safe, and read-only access to SQL databases for AI clients. Each database engine (SQLite, libSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Postgres) is packaged separately with consistent tooling and guardrails.

## Key Features
- Consistent two-tool interface (`execute_sql` and `search_objects`) across all supported databases
- Read-only mode enforced by default with row caps and statement timeouts for safety
- Configuration via flags, YAML, or environment variables (never via chat prompts)
- Secrets are redacted in logs and never exposed in tool outputs
- Language-agnostic conformance suite ensures identical behavior across implementations

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides standardized, secure, and AI-friendly access to SQL databases, reducing integration complexity and security risks for RAG systems.
