## Summary
A Go-based MCP server that enables AI assistants (Claude, Cursor, etc.) to programmatically interact with Miro boards, allowing creation, modification, and analysis of boards, stickies, frames, diagrams, and more through 98 tools.

## Key Features
- 98 tools for full CRUD operations on Miro boards, items, frames, and diagrams
- Supports both full (98 tools) and essentials (15 tools) profiles for token efficiency
- Companion CLI (`miro-cli`) and MCP Apps server (`miro-mcp-apps`) for extended functionality
- Token-efficient design with preload token estimates (16.5K for full, 2.4K for essentials)
- Security-aware tools for board sharing and member management with fail-closed defaults

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI assistants to directly manipulate Miro boards, streamlining workflow automation for workshops, retros, and planning sessions in RAG pipelines.
