## Summary
SqlToAi is a secure Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Microsoft SQL Server that enables AI agents and LLMs to interact with databases while protecting sensitive data through on-the-fly anonymization and read-only query enforcement.

## Key Features
- Secure read-only query execution with regex-based command validation to prevent modifying queries
- On-the-fly PII anonymization (scrambling or hashing) to protect sensitive data while preserving data structure
- Dynamic access control via configurable SQL probes to validate database environment (e.g., demo vs. production)
- Schema enrichment with custom metadata from external sources to provide business context to AI agents
- Comprehensive logging and MCP trail for debugging and auditing AI-database interactions

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
SqlToAi enables AI agents to safely and securely interact with SQL Server databases for schema exploration and query execution without exposing sensitive customer data, making it essential for RAG builders working with ERP systems or production databases.
