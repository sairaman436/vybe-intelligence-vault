## Summary
A standalone account scheduler for Sub2API that dynamically manages account states, load balancing, and token group failover without modifying Sub2API's source code or database. It integrates channel monitoring, real requests, balance, multiplier, and account status to automate pauses, recoveries, and disaster recovery.

## Key Features
- Automated account state management (pause, resume, load adjustment) based on real-time monitoring and historical data
- Multi-tier token group failover (primary, backup, emergency) for disaster recovery
- Embedded Vue.js management UI with strict permission controls
- Deterministic scheduling with dry-run mode for safe initial deployment
- Smart agent for persistent business logic, policy versioning, and automated operations

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides critical runtime orchestration for AI inference pipelines by ensuring high availability and efficient resource utilization without modifying upstream systems.
