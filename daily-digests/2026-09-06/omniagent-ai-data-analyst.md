## Summary
OmniAgent is a governed answer engine for tabular data that translates plain English questions into SQL queries or refuses to answer if uncertain, ensuring accuracy and safety. It combines a semantic layer with a deterministic gate stack to validate SQL execution and prevent harmful or incorrect outputs.

## Key Features
- Semantic layer-first architecture with deterministic SQL compilation for common queries
- 8-gate deterministic guardrail stack enforcing row caps, timeouts, PII masking, and provenance tracking
- Verified-query cache for zero-model-call fast paths that re-execute cached SQL against current data
- Backwards-generated golden sets for evaluation, ensuring accuracy metrics are derived from real execution
- Multi-model tiering with cheap models for routine tasks and stronger models reserved for SQL generation

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
OmniAgent provides a robust, governed framework for translating natural language queries into accurate SQL with built-in safety mechanisms, making it essential for RAG builders who need reliable data access without hallucinations or security risks.
