## Summary
A TypeScript-based MCP server that enables MCP-compatible AI clients to generate images from text prompts by interfacing with either the OpenAI API or ChatGPT's web interface, returning structured metadata and saved image files.

## Key Features
- Supports multiple backends (API, ChatGPT web, auto-fallback) for image generation
- Returns structured metadata and saved image files with deterministic naming
- No ChatGPT API key required for ChatGPT web mode
- Isolated backend implementations for maintainability and extensibility
- Deterministic output directory structure with metadata.json for each generation

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It bridges MCP-compatible AI clients with image generation capabilities, enabling seamless integration of visual outputs into AI workflows without requiring direct API key management for web-based modes.
