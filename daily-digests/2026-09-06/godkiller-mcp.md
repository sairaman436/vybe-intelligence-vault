## Summary
GODKILLER MCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to enforce rigorous, disk-based verification for AI coding agents, ensuring tasks are only marked as 'done' after concrete evidence is proven on disk. It acts as a judge to prevent false completions and token bloat by enforcing phase gates and verification steps.

## Key Features
- Enforces disk-based verification before marking tasks as complete, preventing false 'done' claims by AI agents.
- Provides a structured phase-gated pipeline (plan → edit → verify → claim_done) to ensure disciplined workflow execution.
- Integrates with Google Antigravity, Cursor, and Claude Desktop as an MCP server for seamless agent orchestration.
- Includes a suite of tools (e.g., `gk_verify`, `gk_phase`, `gk_task`) for evidence collection, phase management, and safe edits.
- Supports customizable write guards and hooks to enforce security and prevent unauthorized disk modifications.

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It ensures AI agents cannot falsely claim task completion by enforcing disk-based proof, reducing errors and improving reliability in RAG and AI stacks.
