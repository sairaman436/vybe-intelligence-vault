## Summary
offsec-mcp is an MCP server that provides offensive-security tooling for AI agents, enabling authorized reconnaissance, CVE intelligence gathering, JavaScript analysis, and port scanning through the Model Context Protocol.

## Key Features
- Exposes security tools (subdomain enumeration, CVE search, JS analysis, port scanning) as MCP tools for AI agents
- Enforces authorization scopes to prevent unauthorized active scanning
- Passive OSINT tools (CT logs, DNS, RDAP, NVD) run freely without scope restrictions
- Redacts sensitive data (e.g., secrets) in outputs to prevent accidental exposure
- Supports both inline and file-based authorization scope configuration

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to safely and efficiently perform authorized offensive-security tasks, bridging the gap between AI orchestration and traditional security tooling.
