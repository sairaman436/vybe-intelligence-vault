## Summary
A Hermes Agent platform plugin that bridges Meshtastic LoRa mesh networks with the Hermes AI agent framework. It enables bidirectional text communication between mesh nodes and Hermes sessions, handling direct messages, channel broadcasts, and long-reply chunking for LoRa-safe delivery.

## Key Features
- Bridges Meshtastic text messages into Hermes Agent sessions for direct messages and channel broadcasts
- Splits long replies into numbered LoRa-safe chunks with configurable byte limits and delays
- Exposes mesh tools for node management, signal quality checks, and telemetry queries
- Stores telemetry, position, and signal history in SQLite for analysis and retention
- Supports both USB serial and TCP/IP connections to gateway nodes

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to interact with LoRa mesh networks, expanding AI applications to offline or low-bandwidth environments where traditional internet connectivity is unreliable or unavailable.
