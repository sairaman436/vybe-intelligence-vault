## Summary
ClimaSafe is an early-stage early warning system that predicts heat and cold risk levels by province and day using machine learning models (XGBoost, RandomForest, LSTM) trained on ERA5 meteorological data and MoMo mortality statistics. It prioritizes recall to avoid missing high-risk days, with deployment-ready pipelines and a Telegram bot for alerts.

## Key Features
- Multi-model ensemble (XGBoost for heat, RandomForest for cold, LSTM hybrid) with calibrated recall-focused performance
- Integration with ERA5, AEMET, Open-Meteo, and MoMo datasets for accurate risk estimation
- Temporal cross-validation and conformal prediction for uncertainty-aware predictions
- Telegram bot (spacebot) for real-time alerts and personalized risk communication
- SHAP explainability and km² risk mapping for interpretability and actionable insights

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
ClimaSafe provides a critical early warning system for heat and cold risks, enabling proactive public health interventions and reducing mortality by leveraging AI-driven predictions from meteorological and mortality data.
