## Summary
delx-memory is a local-first persistent memory MCP server that provides a shared SQLite-based key/value store for AI agents. It enables cross-session and cross-tool context continuity by exposing a secure, secret-blocking memory layer that any MCP-speaking client can read or write.

## Key Features
- Shared SQLite store for cross-agent context persistence
- Secret-blocking to prevent accidental credential storage
- Full-text search (FTS5) with BM25 ranking and stemming
- TTL support for lazy expiry of ephemeral data
- Explicit user intent requirement for mutations to prevent unauthorized writes

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
delx-memory enables seamless context continuity across AI agents and sessions, eliminating the need to repeatedly provide the same context and ensuring privacy by blocking sensitive data storage.
