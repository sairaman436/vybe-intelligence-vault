## Summary
WinBridge MCP is a TypeScript-based Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI agents to securely execute PowerShell commands, transfer files, and capture screenshots on Windows hosts over HTTP. It bridges the gap between terminal-based agents and GUI-first Windows environments without requiring RDP.

## Key Features
- Secure PowerShell command execution with persistent sessions
- File transfer capabilities (upload/download) with sandboxed paths
- Screenshot capture of Windows desktop (opt-in and role-restricted)
- Built-in Cloudflare tunnel for public access without firewall changes
- Per-user authorization with roles, command allow/deny lists, and audit logging

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
WinBridge enables AI agents to interact with Windows systems programmatically without RDP, providing a secure and scalable way to automate tasks, transfer files, and capture screenshots while enforcing access controls and audit trails.
