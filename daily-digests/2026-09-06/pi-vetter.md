## Summary
pi-vetter is a security vetting tool for Pi extension packages that evaluates candidate versions against multiple evidence sources to provide an ALLOW/ASK/DENY verdict before installation or updates. It ensures users can make informed decisions about package safety by analyzing metadata, vulnerabilities, provenance, and static code patterns.

## Key Features
- Multi-layered scanning (metadata, OSV, provenance, static analysis, diff, VirusTotal, Socket.dev)
- Interactive TUI for approval-based installation of vetted packages
- Fail-closed verdict system (no silent ALLOW on scanner failures)
- Provenance verification with Sigstore and npm attestations
- Caching and configurable rules for tailored security policies

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides critical pre-installation security checks for AI extension packages, reducing the risk of malicious or vulnerable code entering the supply chain.
