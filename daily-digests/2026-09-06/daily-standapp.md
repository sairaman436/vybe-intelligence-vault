## Summary
Daily-StandAPP is a Kotlin-based CLI and MCP server for generating structured daily standup summaries from Git repositories using typed pipelines and LLM inference. It supports multiple backends (SKAINET, REST_API) and formats (markdown, JSON, text) with built-in benchmarking for evaluating LLM performance and quality.

## Key Features
- Typed Kotlin DSL pipeline for standup generation (preprocess → prompt → infer → postprocess)
- Supports multiple output formats (markdown, JSON, text) with structured validation
- MCP server for tool-calling mode to fetch commits dynamically via `get_recent_commits`
- Built-in benchmarking module to evaluate LLM backends on quality and performance metrics
- Cross-platform compatibility with local (SKAINET, Ollama) and cloud (OpenAI-compatible) backends

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a robust, pipeline-driven approach to automate standup summaries from Git data, enabling RAG builders to integrate structured, high-quality daily reports into their workflows with minimal manual effort.
