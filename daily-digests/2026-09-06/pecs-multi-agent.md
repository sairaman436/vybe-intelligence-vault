## Summary
PECS is a multi-agent collaboration framework designed to address limitations of single-agent systems by dividing complex tasks into four specialized roles: Planner, Executor, Critic, and Synthesizer. It implements a Plan-Execute-Reflect loop with token budget-aware scheduling and AST-based sandboxing to improve task accuracy and reduce costs.

## Key Features
- Four specialized agent roles (Planner, Executor, Critic, Synthesizer) for task decomposition and quality assurance
- Token budget-aware scheduling with three-tier degradation (70%/85%/95%) to control costs
- AST-based sandboxing for secure code execution and error prevention
- Critic-driven reflection and error correction mechanism for improved output quality
- Heuristic fallback layer for zero-token tasks (e.g., simple calculations)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
PECS provides a structured, cost-efficient approach to multi-agent collaboration that significantly improves task accuracy and reduces LLM token consumption, making it ideal for RAG pipelines requiring complex reasoning and tool integration.
