## Summary
MCP ZAP Server exposes OWASP ZAP through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) over streamable HTTP, enabling AI agents to perform safe, guided, and operator-controlled web security scans with findings, reports, and production guardrails.

## Key Features
- Exposes OWASP ZAP via MCP for agentic security workflows without brittle glue scripts
- Provides guided scans (spider, active, passive, API imports) with operator-controlled defaults
- Supports multi-layer authentication (API key, JWT, target authentication) for secure access
- Offers deployment flexibility with Docker Compose, JVM containers, and Helm charts
- Includes operational guardrails like rate limits, quotas, audit events, and structured logging

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to safely and autonomously perform web security scans while maintaining operator control and auditability, bridging the gap between AI-driven automation and security best practices.
