## Summary
A read-only Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects AI clients like Claude or Cursor to the Qobrix real-estate CRM, enabling natural language queries for listings, leads, viewings, offers, contracts, and analytics via 46+ tools aligned with RESO Data Dictionary 2.0 workflows.

## Key Features
- 46+ read-only tools for CRM entities (properties, leads, contracts, etc.) with RESO Data Dictionary 2.0 alignment
- Analytics tools (qobrix_count, qobrix_top_values, qobrix_aggregate) for real-time metrics without custom scripts
- Redis-backed response caching to reduce API load on repeat queries
- Canonical real-estate workflows pre-mapped for LLM navigation (listings, leads, sales pipeline, etc.)
- 167 automated tests ensuring reliability and schema validation via Zod

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a standardized, read-only MCP layer for Qobrix CRM data, enabling AI agents to interact with real estate workflows without requiring custom integrations or write access.
