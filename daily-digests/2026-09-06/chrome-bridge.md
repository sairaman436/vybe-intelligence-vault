## Summary
Chrome Bridge is an MCP server that enables Claude Code to interact with a real, logged-in Chrome browser via a WebSocket bridge and a Chrome extension, providing 59 specialized web-development tools for automation, auditing, and testing without requiring CDP debugging ports or paid plans.

## Key Features
- Connects Claude Code to a real Chrome browser via WebSocket bridge and extension, enabling direct interaction with logged-in sessions
- Provides 59 specialized tools for navigation, DOM inspection, audits, network mocking, and visual regression testing
- Supports ChromeOS/Crostini with real host Chrome sessions, unlike containerized alternatives
- Token-efficient design with capped outputs, small default tool surface, and zero-token escape hatches for CLI usage
- Includes launch mode for headless CI environments with isolated Chromium instances and ephemeral profiles

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Chrome Bridge enables AI agents like Claude Code to interact with real, logged-in Chrome browsers for accurate web automation, auditing, and testing without relying on paid plans or containerized environments, making it essential for RAG builders needing real-world browser interactions.
