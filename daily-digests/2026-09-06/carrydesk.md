## Summary
Carrydesk provides cross-sectional funding-carry rankings for Hyperliquid perpetual futures, published hourly as an API. It ranks liquid perps by trailing 14-day mean funding, enabling users to identify structural risk premiums for long/short strategies, with free and paid endpoints.

## Key Features
- Hourly updated rankings of Hyperliquid perpetuals by trailing 14-day mean funding
- Free and paid API endpoints with USDC-based paywall (x402 protocol)
- MCP server integration for AI agents (Claude MCP)
- Detailed spread metrics (mean, trimmed, median) to avoid illiquidity bias
- Local development mode with open paywall for testing

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Carrydesk provides real-time structural risk premium data for perpetual futures, enabling AI-driven trading strategies to identify mispriced funding rates with minimal overhead.
