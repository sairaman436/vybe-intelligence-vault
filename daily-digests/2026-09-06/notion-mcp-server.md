## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI agents (Claude, Cursor, VS Code, etc.) to interact with Notion via a lightweight, headless token-based authentication system. It provides read/write access to Notion pages, databases, blocks, comments, and files with optimized tooling for agent-driven workflows.

## Key Features
- Lightweight MCP server with 97% smaller tool footprint (422 tokens vs 17,163 tokens) for efficient AI agent interactions
- Supports batch mutations with atomic rollback, idempotency keys, and automatic retry on rate limits
- Enables full markdown round-trip for page content editing and file uploads (single/multi-part)
- Designed for headless and CI/CD environments with token-based authentication (PAT or internal integration)
- Provides 43 operations across pages, databases, blocks, comments, and templates with flattened, token-efficient responses

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
This server enables AI agents to seamlessly interact with Notion in automated, headless environments, reducing context overhead and enabling reliable, batch-driven workflows for RAG and AI stack builders.
