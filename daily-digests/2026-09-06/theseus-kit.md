## Summary
theseus-kit is an MCP server designed to safely inspect, edit, template, and publish TFRobot configurations via the standard MCP protocol. It exposes A2C-SMCP-compatible resources and skills for structured configuration management.

## Key Features
- Provides 9 MCP tools for full lifecycle configuration management (read, write, validate, publish)
- Exposes A2C-SMCP-compatible `window://` and `skill://` resources for real-time state and structured LLM guidance
- Supports dual authentication paths: explicit user PAT (token exchange) and OAuth 2.0 for interactive use
- Implements optimistic concurrency control, progressive disclosure, and strict redaction for security
- Includes E2E testing and CI/CD pipelines for reliable deployment

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables secure, structured, and automated management of robot configurations via MCP, critical for AI-driven robotic systems integration.
