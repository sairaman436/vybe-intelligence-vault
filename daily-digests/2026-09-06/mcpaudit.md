## Summary
MCPAudit is a security-focused tool that audits locally configured MCP servers for permission risks, prompt injection threats, and schema drift. It provides read-only analysis of MCP server capabilities, detects SSRF-shaped tools, and offers policy-based enforcement for CI/CD pipelines.

## Key Features
- Capability inventory of MCP server tools, prompts, and resources with permission categorization (file_read, file_write, network, shell_execution, destructive, exfiltration)
- Config-only inference mode for zero-touch analysis without spawning servers or contacting endpoints
- Risk scoring (0-10 composite score) with detailed breakdowns and stable finding metadata
- Local policy gates for CI/CD enforcement and SARIF/HTML report generation
- Prompt injection, SSRF, and schema drift detection with remediation suggestions

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides essential security auditing for MCP-based AI agents, ensuring safe and controlled access to tools and resources in AI engineering stacks.
