## Summary
RLM is an MCP server that provides persistent memory for Claude Code, solving the context loss issue during `/compact` operations by automatically saving insights, conversation chunks, and decisions across sessions.

## Key Features
- Auto-save before context loss triggered by `/compact` or auto-compact events
- Hybrid search combining BM25, semantic similarity, and fuzzy matching for robust recall
- Multi-project organization with smart retention policies (archive/purge/immunity)
- Sub-agent skills for parallel and isolated analysis of conversation chunks
- Zero-configuration installation with support for Docker, PyPI, and Git

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
RLM ensures critical context and decisions are preserved across Claude Code sessions, eliminating repetitive explanations and enabling seamless long-term project memory for AI-driven workflows.
