## Summary
RLG (RustLogs) is a high-performance, near-lock-free structured logging ecosystem for Rust, featuring a core logging engine, CLI tools, MCP server, OTLP exporter, middleware, WASM bindings, PII redaction, and analytics utilities. It enables efficient log ingestion, processing, and analysis with sub-microsecond performance.

## Key Features
- Near-lock-free structured logging with a 65k-slot ring buffer for sub-µs ingest
- Comprehensive ecosystem including CLI tools, MCP server, OTLP exporter, and WASM bindings
- Built-in PII redaction using Aho-Corasick fused regex for compliance and security
- Tower middleware for HTTP services and automatic process enrichment via eBPF
- Log analytics and digest tools for operational dashboards and error triage

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
RLG provides a high-performance, scalable foundation for logging in AI systems, enabling efficient log ingestion, processing, and analysis critical for debugging, monitoring, and compliance in production environments.
