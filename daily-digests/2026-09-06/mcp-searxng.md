## Summary
mcp-searxng is a remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that bridges AI assistants to the SearXNG meta search engine via Streamable HTTP, enabling secure and scalable web search capabilities without local installation or daemon management.

## Key Features
- Remote MCP server over Streamable HTTP, eliminating local installation requirements
- Multi-arch static binary with distroless base image for security and minimal footprint
- Built-in rate limiting (global and per-client) and Prometheus metrics for monitoring
- Full support for SearXNG search parameters (categories, language, time range, pagination)
- Pre-configured convenience tools for news and image searches

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI assistants to securely and scalably integrate web search capabilities via a standardized MCP interface, reducing deployment friction and enhancing security posture.
