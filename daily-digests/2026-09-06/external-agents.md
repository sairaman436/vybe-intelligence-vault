## Summary
@mrrlin-dev/external-agents is an MCP server that routes coding agent workloads across 20+ low-cost LLMs, enabling cost reductions of 10-100x by treating multiple provider buckets as a single token pool with round-robin dispatch, auto-fallback, and rate-limit awareness.

## Key Features
- Unified provider pool with round-robin dispatch and auto-fallback on rate limits or errors
- Built-in `dispatch` and `pick_agents` MCP tools for seamless integration with coding agents
- Local dashboard for key management, provider state monitoring, and usage tracking
- Automated provider health audits to detect model unavailability or authentication issues
- Support for 28+ providers including free tiers, pay-as-you-go APIs, and subscriptions

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables RAG builders to drastically reduce LLM costs while maintaining high reliability by intelligently routing requests across diverse, cost-effective providers.
