## Summary
A lightweight MCP server that acts as a client for the Lazaretto API, enabling agents to verify the safety of skills, tools, or packages before installation by checking against a known-bad artifact database or performing deterministic scans.

## Key Features
- Thin client for the Lazaretto API with no embedded detection logic, ensuring auditability
- Two primary tools: `known_bad_lookup` (exact-hash match) and `scan_artifact` (deterministic verdict with evidence)
- Supports scanning npm packages, GitHub repos, ClawHub skills, raw URLs, or inline text
- Free tier available for basic lookups; paid scans require API key or prepaid credits
- Deterministic verdicts (`malicious`, `flagged`, `clear`, `error`) with supporting evidence

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a critical security layer for AI agents by verifying the safety of tools or packages before installation, reducing the risk of malicious artifacts in RAG or agent workflows.
