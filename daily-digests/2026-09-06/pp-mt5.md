## Summary
pp-mt5 is a CLI tool that transforms MetaTrader 5 into a forensic trading record with a tick-accurate replay engine, enabling queryable market decisions, live trading operations, and quant workflows directly from the shell or via an MCP server for AI assistants.

## Key Features
- Local SQLite mirror for offline queryable trading data with microsecond response times
- Safety-first write pipeline with dry-run, hash-confirmation, and audit logging for live trading
- Tick-accurate replay engine for backtesting and strategy validation
- MCP server integration enabling AI assistants to interact with MT5 via 18 tools
- Multi-account support with configurable guardrails (max volume, daily loss limits, kill switches)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It bridges the gap between trading platforms and AI agents by providing a secure, queryable, and auditable interface to MetaTrader 5, enabling automated decision-making and quant workflows without sacrificing safety or transparency.
