## Summary
MCP server for transferring conversation context between AI chats or different projects within the same AI, enabling seamless handoffs with metadata, tags, and search capabilities while ensuring prompt injection protection and lightweight in-memory storage.

## Key Features
- Prompt injection protection with untrusted-content markers and boundary tokens
- Tag-based search and filtering for handoffs with structured labels
- Sender metadata support for orchestrator integration (project, dispatch ID, agent ID)
- Auto-connect and auto-reconnection for seamless server discovery and recovery
- Memory-based storage with FIFO cleanup and configurable TTL for temporary context sharing

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables reliable, secure, and context-preserving handoffs between AI agents or sessions, critical for building robust RAG systems that require seamless conversation continuity.
