## Summary
DataQ is a data quality monitoring platform built on Great Expectations, designed to validate, track, and alert on data health across multiple cloud data sources like Snowflake, ADLS Gen2, S3, Unity Catalog, and Apache Iceberg. It integrates with orchestration tools such as ADF, Airflow, and dbt, and exposes an MCP server for AI assistant interactions.

## Key Features
- Multi-datasource support (Snowflake, ADLS Gen2, S3, Unity Catalog, Apache Iceberg) with native integrations
- Asset-centric health tracking, lineage visualization, and incident management with severity tiers
- Orchestration integration (ADF, Airflow, dbt) for pipeline-aware monitoring and triggering
- MCP server exposing 47 curated tools for AI assistant interactions (read-only and state-changing)
- Comprehensive alerting (Teams, Slack, email) with first-failure dedup and per-check snoozing

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
DataQ ensures data reliability and observability in AI pipelines by validating data quality across sources and orchestration tools, reducing hallucinations and improving RAG system performance.
