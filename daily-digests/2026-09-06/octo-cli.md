## Summary
octo-cli is a metadata-driven, single-binary CLI tool designed as a thin REST client for AI Agent Bots. It auto-registers 105 operations across 9 domains from embedded OpenAPI specs, enabling structured JSON envelope I/O for agent runtimes like OpenClaw or Claude Code.

## Key Features
- Metadata-driven command registration from embedded OpenAPI specs (105 operations across 9 domains)
- Structured JSON envelope output with pagination, rate-limit metadata, and deterministic error taxonomy
- Multi-backend routing with dynamic base URL selection per operation
- Dependency injection via Factory pattern for testability and modularity
- Bot-only authentication (App Bot, User Bot, User API key) with capability-based routing

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
octo-cli simplifies integration of AI agent runtimes with backend services by providing a thin, metadata-driven CLI that handles structured I/O and authentication, reducing boilerplate for RAG builders.
