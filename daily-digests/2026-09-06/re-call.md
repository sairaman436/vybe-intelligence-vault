## Summary
RE-call is a retrieval-augmented system designed to provide trustworthy memory for AI agents by ensuring retrieved information includes confidence, provenance, and validity. It abstains from answering when uncertain rather than guessing, addressing issues like stale or superseded memories that plague traditional RAG systems.

## Key Features
- Enforces memory supersession and validity at retrieval time, demoting stale or superseded memories regardless of cosine similarity
- Provides calibrated abstention when no confident answer exists, avoiding hallucinations
- Zero-cost memory ingestion and retrieval (no LLM calls required), using local embeddings and PostgreSQL
- Supports hybrid retrieval (dense + sparse) and cross-encoders for improved accuracy
- Offers drop-in integrations for LangChain, LlamaIndex, and MCP for seamless agent integration

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It ensures AI agents retrieve only accurate, up-to-date, and trustworthy memories, eliminating hallucinations and stale decisions while operating entirely offline and at zero cost.
