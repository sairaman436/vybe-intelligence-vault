## Summary
GoldenMatch is a zero-config entity resolution engine that transforms messy, duplicate customer records from multiple sources into stable, durable golden entities with full provenance, survivorship policies, and tamper-evident audit logs. It outperforms expert-tuned Splink in benchmarks while offering a transaction-native control plane for identity management.

## Key Features
- Zero-config entity resolution with Fellegi-Sunter algorithm, outperforming Splink in benchmarks
- Durable golden entities with stable UUIDv7 `entity_id`s, per-field provenance, and survivorship policies
- Transaction-native control plane with append-only audit logs and tamper-evident hashing
- Arrow-native Rust kernels for high-performance matching (250M rows in 11.2 minutes)
- Multi-language support (Python, TypeScript, SQL) with WASM and native backends for Postgres/DuckDB

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
GoldenMatch provides the critical preprocessing layer for RAG systems by resolving messy, duplicate customer data into clean, stable golden entities with full provenance, ensuring accurate and traceable data integration.
