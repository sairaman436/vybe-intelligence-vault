## Summary
kb-agent is a personal knowledge base system that auto-generates and indexes project documentation using RAG, enabling an AI agent to answer questions about projects and dependencies. It supports tool-use for interacting with external services and exposes a local vector store via an MCP server.

## Key Features
- Auto-generates Markdown stubs for projects and dependencies using Anthropic API
- Local vector store (ChromaDB) with incremental indexing and retrieval evaluation
- AI agent with tool-use capabilities (search_kb, list_projects, classify_snippet, search_notes)
- Built-in MCP server for integration with MCP-compatible clients
- Observability via OpenTelemetry tracing for distributed tool-use loops

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a self-contained, measurable RAG pipeline with tool-use capabilities and MCP integration, enabling AI agents to interact with both static knowledge and live project services.
