## Summary
AgentToolGate (ATG) is a local AI Agent tool governance gateway that intercepts and regulates high-risk tool calls before execution, ensuring policy enforcement, approval workflows, secret management, and audit logging for database queries, GitHub operations, HTTP requests, and MCP tool interactions.

## Key Features
- Pre-execution policy evaluation for high-risk tool calls (database, GitHub, HTTP, MCP)
- Approval workflows for sensitive operations with audit trails
- Connector secret injection and runtime management to prevent credential exposure
- Local action firewall for AI clients (Claude/Codex) to block high-risk filesystem operations
- OpenTelemetry integration for distributed tracing and observability

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
AgentToolGate ensures AI agents cannot execute unauthorized or high-risk operations by enforcing governance policies before tool calls, reducing the attack surface for credential theft, data exfiltration, and persistent compromise in RAG and agentic systems.
