## Summary
ECAZ is a Rust-based PostgreSQL extension designed for high-performance vector storage and retrieval, offering advanced quantization and indexing options for scalable AI applications.

## Key Features
- Supports multiple quantization methods (TurboQuant, PQ-FastScan, RaBitQ) for extreme compression with minimal recall loss
- Four index families (HNSW, IVF, DiskANN, SPIRE) optimized for different use cases and scale
- SIMD-accelerated operations for Graviton 4 (ARM NEON) and Intel x86_64 (AVX2)
- Compatibility with PostgreSQL 17 and 18, with production-ready deployment paths
- Comprehensive benchmarking and performance documentation for informed index selection

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
ECAZ provides a high-performance, scalable, and flexible vector storage solution directly within PostgreSQL, eliminating the need for external vector databases and enabling seamless integration with existing SQL workflows for RAG systems.
