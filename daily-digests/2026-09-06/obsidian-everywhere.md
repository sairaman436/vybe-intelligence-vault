## Summary
Obsidian Everywhere is a graph-native MCP server that exposes an Obsidian vault as a structured graph for AI clients like Codex, ChatGPT, and Claude, enabling advanced graph traversal, contextual search, and safe editing without requiring Obsidian to be open.

## Key Features
- 31 graph-native MCP tools for structured reads, graph traversal, and safe edits
- Real-time SQLite index and in-memory graph engine for n-hop neighborhoods, PageRank, and shortest paths
- Three transport options: stdio, bearer-token HTTP, and OAuth 2.1 HTTP for remote clients
- Incremental parsing and synchronization of vault changes without full rebuilds
- Rollback-capable bulk edits, partial edits, and unresolved link discovery

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It transforms an Obsidian vault into a structured graph for AI clients, enabling precise context retrieval and safe editing, which is critical for building advanced RAG systems with accurate and dynamic knowledge access.
