## Summary
Vestige is a local-first, long-term memory system for AI agents that runs as an MCP server, enabling agents to remember decisions, detect contradictions, and trace failures back to root causes. It operates entirely offline after a one-time model download, storing data in a local SQLite file.

## Key Features
- Local-first memory storage with SQLite, ensuring data never leaves the machine
- Retroactive Salience Backfill for tracing failures to root causes, even when cause and symptom share no vocabulary
- Contradiction detection and resolution via `claim_contradicts_memory` status
- Prediction-Error Gating and FSRS-6 spaced repetition for efficient memory management
- 13 MCP tools for seamless integration with any MCP-capable agent

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Vestige solves the critical problem of AI agents repeating past mistakes by providing a local, causal memory system that can trace failures to their root causes, enabling more reliable and self-correcting AI workflows.
