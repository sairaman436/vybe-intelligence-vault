## Summary
A local Kimi Code plugin that implements a three-layer memory system (global user, per-project durable + working, and session archives) via MCP tools, lifecycle hooks, and slash commands. It enables persistent, structured memory management for AI agents with vector similarity search, auto-extraction, and decay-based importance scoring.

## Key Features
- Three-layer memory architecture (global, per-project durable + working, session archives)
- Vector similarity search with hybrid FTS5 + cosine ranking (optional embeddings)
- Auto-extraction of memories from conversation summaries via LLM calls
- Durable memory operations with scope-aware tools (save, recall, update, delete, bulk operations)
- Decay-based importance scoring and manual reinforcement of memory confidence

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a robust, local memory system for AI agents that enables persistent context, structured recall, and auto-extraction of insights from conversations, critical for building advanced RAG systems.
