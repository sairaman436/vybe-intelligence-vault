## Summary
BKS open-bridge is a plain-text git repository that serves as a persistent, version-controlled workspace for AI coding agents (e.g., Claude Code, Codex, Copilot CLI). It enables agents to retain context across sessions by reading and writing structured markdown and YAML files, eliminating the need for manual re-explanation of projects, clients, or prior work.

## Key Features
- Reads and writes context from plain-text files in a git repo at session start, ensuring continuity across agent sessions.
- Supports per-client or per-context workspace isolation via structured YAML and markdown files (e.g., board.md, log.md).
- Implements a CORE/USER split to safely merge upstream improvements without clobbering private data.
- Provides a runnable demo workspace for immediate testing and adoption.
- Includes safety guards (e.g., push-guard) to prevent accidental data exposure.

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a vendor-agnostic, persistent context layer for AI agents, reducing setup overhead and enabling seamless continuity across sessions without relying on proprietary databases or SaaS platforms.
