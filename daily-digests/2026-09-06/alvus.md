## Summary
Alvus is a lightweight Go proxy designed to silently absorb rate limit errors (429s) from AI API providers, enabling continuous operation of AI agents and tools by rotating API keys and managing cooldowns. It acts as a zero-dependency intermediary between agents and upstream APIs.

## Key Features
- Silent absorption of 429/502/503 errors with automatic retries using round-robin key rotation
- Proactive rate pacing to prevent hitting provider limits (configurable RPM limits per key)
- Zero dependencies with a single static binary (~5 MB) and minimal RAM usage (~2 MB)
- Interactive dashboard for real-time monitoring, configuration, and key management
- Supports streaming responses (SSE/chunked) with zero buffering and compatibility with OpenAI-compatible APIs

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Alvus ensures uninterrupted AI agent operations by eliminating rate limit disruptions, making it essential for builders relying on free-tier or limited-rate AI APIs.
