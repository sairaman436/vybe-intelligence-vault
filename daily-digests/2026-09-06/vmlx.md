## Summary
vMLX is a self-hosted inference server for running LLMs, VLMs, and image generation models on Apple Silicon with OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible APIs. It supports advanced features like speculative decoding, distributed inference, and JANG quantization for efficient local AI workloads.

## Key Features
- OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible HTTP API for seamless integration with existing tools
- Advanced caching with 5-layer architecture (L1 memory, L2 disk, KV quantization, paged cache)
- JANG 2-bit quantization outperforming MLX 4-bit with higher accuracy and lower memory usage
- Distributed inference across multiple Macs for handling large models beyond single-device capacity
- Support for LLMs, VLMs, image generation/editing, audio (TTS/STT), and tool calling

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
vMLX enables efficient, local inference of large AI models on Apple Silicon with advanced optimizations, making it essential for RAG builders seeking high-performance, privacy-preserving, and cost-effective solutions.
