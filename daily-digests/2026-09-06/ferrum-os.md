## Summary
FerrumOS is a bare-metal x86_64 operating system written in Rust, designed to grant an AI agent full hardware control through capability-gated syscalls. It features a real desktop environment, multi-user accounts, a package manager, and a ReAct-based agent daemon (`heliox-daemon`) that integrates with local or cloud LLMs.

## Key Features
- Full hardware control for AI agents via capability-gated syscalls, not sandboxed APIs
- Real desktop environment with a composable window manager and GUI apps
- ReAct-based agent daemon (`heliox-daemon`) with multi-provider LLM support and safety gates
- Multi-user accounts with persistent storage and capability-based permissions
- Package manager (`ferrumpkg`) for dynamic ELF binary execution and management

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
FerrumOS demonstrates how to integrate AI agents directly into bare-metal systems with full hardware access, offering a blueprint for secure, capability-gated agent orchestration in real-world environments.
