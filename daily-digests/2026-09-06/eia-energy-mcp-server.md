## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides a standardized interface to query and browse the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) API v2. It enables structured access to electricity, petroleum, natural gas, coal, and other energy datasets via 7 specialized tools, supporting both STDIO and Streamable HTTP transports.

## Key Features
- 7 specialized tools for browsing, describing, searching, and querying EIA datasets with natural language support
- In-process caching of route metadata and facet values to minimize API calls and improve performance
- DataCanvas (DuckDB) integration for handling large result sets with SQL querying capabilities
- Supports both STDIO and Streamable HTTP transports for flexible deployment
- Built on @cyanheads/mcp-ts-core for modularity, error handling, and pluggable authentication/storage backends

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a standardized, efficient interface to the EIA API, enabling AI systems to retrieve structured energy data for RAG applications without direct API integration complexity.
