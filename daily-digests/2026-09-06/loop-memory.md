## Summary
Loop Memory is a local-first, agent-agnostic memory system that captures, scores, and distills agent conversations into a curated wiki, enabling persistent knowledge across sessions. It supports multiple AI agents (Codex, Claude, Hermes, OpenClaw) via hooks or a generic watcher CLI, and re-injects distilled knowledge into future interactions.

## Key Features
- Multi-agent capture via hooks or generic watcher CLI for any agent with on-disk transcripts
- Hybrid recall system combining BM25, semantic search, and entity-based retrieval with temporal reasoning
- Four-stage evolution pipeline: capture, score, cluster, distill, and re-inject knowledge into future sessions
- Local-first SQLite storage with zero external dependencies, ensuring privacy and offline functionality
- Dashboard and Web UI for real-time monitoring, manual consolidation, and interactive exploration of distilled knowledge

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Loop Memory provides a critical bridge for RAG systems by enabling persistent, evolving context across agent sessions without relying on external services, ensuring privacy and seamless integration with local AI workflows.
