## Summary
doc-mcp is a local Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to authenticate, crawl, and index documentation sites for AI clients. It uses Playwright for authentication and crawling, SQLite for storage, and exposes indexed content via MCP tools for keyword and semantic search.

## Key Features
- Local MCP server for authenticated documentation sites with Playwright-based login flows
- SQLite full-text and vector indexing for keyword and semantic search
- Modular architecture with separate auth, crawl, and server components
- Supports containerized deployment for isolation and reproducibility
- Fallback mechanisms for resilience (e.g., degraded vector search if sidecar unavailable)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI clients to securely and efficiently retrieve up-to-date documentation content for RAG pipelines without relying on external APIs.
