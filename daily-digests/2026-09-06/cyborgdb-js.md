## Summary
The CyborgDB JavaScript/TypeScript SDK provides a client library for interacting with CyborgDB, an encrypted vector database that enables similarity search directly on ciphertext. The SDK supports client-side key management, metadata filtering, and integration with KMS for enhanced security.

## Key Features
- Search on encrypted data with client-side keys, ensuring only query results are decrypted
- Disk-backed encrypted DiskIVF index with near-plaintext recall performance
- Support for metadata filtering (equality and range predicates) on encrypted data
- Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) and Hold Your Own Key (HYOK) options via AWS KMS or Secrets Manager
- Per-tenant key isolation with cryptographic RBAC for secure multi-tenancy

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables secure, encrypted vector search for RAG systems, ensuring data privacy while maintaining high performance and flexibility in key management.
