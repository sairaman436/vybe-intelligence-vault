## Summary
Codex Free is a local MCP (Model Context Protocol) bridge server that enables ChatGPT Web Pro to interact with a user's machine by executing tools like file operations, shell commands, and git operations. It acts as an intermediary between ChatGPT and a local project directory via a public tunnel URL.

## Key Features
- Enables ChatGPT Web Pro to execute tools on a local machine via MCP protocol over Streamable HTTP
- Supports file operations (read/write/list/tree), shell commands, and git operations with path safety checks
- Configurable via CLI flags or a JSON config file for allowed commands, timeouts, and directory exclusions
- Secure by default with path traversal prevention and command allowlisting
- Exposes a local server via public tunnels (ngrok/Cloudflare) for remote ChatGPT access

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It bridges the gap between ChatGPT and local development environments, enabling AI-driven coding assistants to perform real-world file and system operations securely.
