## Summary
mcp-standardnotes is an MCP-compatible server that provides secure read/write access to Standard Notes vaults, enabling AI agents like Claude to interact with end-to-end encrypted notes while keeping the master key local. It leverages protocol 004 and libsodium for cryptographic operations.

## Key Features
- Secure read/write access to Standard Notes vaults with end-to-end encryption
- Local stdio-only transport ensuring no network exposure of master keys
- Full CRUD operations for notes and tags via MCP tools
- OS keychain integration for secure session storage
- Supports both official Standard Notes cloud and self-hosted instances

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to securely interact with end-to-end encrypted note vaults without exposing sensitive data, bridging the gap between AI workflows and personal knowledge management.
