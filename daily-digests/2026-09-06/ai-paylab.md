## Summary
agent-paylab is a Python-based sandbox tool for prototyping AI agent payment decision logic entirely offline. It simulates, compares, and negotiates across multiple payment protocols (e.g., x402, Lightning L402, Web Monetization) without requiring real accounts, API keys, or sandbox environments, while generating cryptographically signed receipts for verification.

## Key Features
- Simulates 9+ payment protocols (x402, Lightning L402, Web Monetization, etc.) without real payment rails
- Multi-round negotiation engine for seller price optimization using expected-value calculations
- Deterministic and experimental LLM-based decision pipelines for agentic commerce
- Generates tamper-proof Ed25519-signed receipts for every simulated transaction
- CLI and Python API for seamless integration into agent workflows

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI engineers to prototype and test agent payment decision logic locally, accelerating development of agentic commerce systems without financial or API dependencies.
