## Summary
quickthink is a local-first CLI and Python library that wraps Ollama-backed LLM calls with a compressed plan-then-answer scaffold and latency-aware routing. It adds a validated planning step for multi-step prompts while bypassing simple ones for efficiency, optimizing small model performance in constrained environments.

## Key Features
- Three execution modes (lite, two_pass, direct) for flexible inference control
- Latency-aware routing with adaptive planning lanes (skip, 12-token, max-token)
- Strict plan grammar validation and fallback mechanisms for reliability
- Local eval harness for reproducible quality checks and benchmarking
- Hidden plan logging with optional display for transparency

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables efficient, reliable local LLM inference for RAG builders by optimizing small model performance through structured planning and latency-aware routing.
