## Summary
pbx-mcp is an MCP server that enables AI assistants to inspect and control Asterisk and FreeSWITCH PBX systems via a unified interface. It abstracts the complexity of PBX command sets, allowing models to query live system status, endpoints, and dialplans without manual context switching.

## Key Features
- Unified tool surface for Asterisk (AMI) and FreeSWITCH (ESL) with read-only and write-mode capabilities
- Safety mechanisms including read-only defaults, command allow-lists, word-level scanning, and output clamping
- Prebuilt Docker image for easy deployment without Node.js on the PBX host
- Environment variable-driven configuration for seamless integration with MCP clients
- Zero third-party dependencies for the core PBX protocol clients

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It bridges the gap between AI assistants and live PBX systems, enabling real-time troubleshooting and automation without manual intervention or deep PBX expertise.
