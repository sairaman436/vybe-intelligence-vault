## Summary
Magpie is a local, security-first web scraper designed for AI agents, extracting clean, token-budgeted content while treating all web data as potentially hostile. It prioritizes safety, transparency, and efficiency by enforcing strict boundaries between trusted agent instructions and untrusted web content.

## Key Features
- Local, keyless operation with no external API calls or telemetry
- Explicit trust boundaries between agent instructions and untrusted web content
- Token budgeting with detailed usage reporting and truncation warnings
- Multiple lenses for tailored content extraction (article, meta, headings, links, analysis, full)
- Built-in safety controls: SSRF protection, robots.txt enforcement, and fail-closed politeness

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Magpie provides a critical security layer for RAG pipelines by safely extracting and token-budgeting web content while preventing prompt injection and SSRF attacks.
