## Summary
maltego-mcp is an MCP server that enables LLMs to programmatically author Maltego graph files and execute OSINT lookups (whois, DNS, ASN, crt.sh) for threat intelligence investigations. It bridges agent-driven automation with Maltego's graph-based OSINT workflows.

## Key Features
- 13 MCP tools for graph authoring (create, add entities/links, save/load graphs)
- Primitive OSINT lookups (whois, DNS, ASN, crt.sh) via MCP tools
- Phase A: TypeScript MCP server for agent-driven graph creation and enrichment
- Phase B: Python TRX transforms for in-Maltego Desktop pivots (optional)
- Basic plan compatibility via `.mtgx` file generation and import

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables LLMs to autonomously generate and enrich Maltego graphs for OSINT investigations, reducing manual point-and-click workflows and integrating threat intelligence directly into agent-driven pipelines.
