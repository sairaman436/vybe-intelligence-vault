## Summary
zj-radar is a Zellij sidebar plugin that provides real-time visibility into AI-agent statuses (e.g., Claude Code, Codex, Opencode) across all tabs in a Zellij session. It enables quick navigation to agent panes needing attention and supports cross-session status tracking without requiring a new terminal or agent orchestrator.

## Key Features
- Live per-tab AI-agent status (working, waiting, done, error) with elapsed time and last message
- One-click navigation to agent panes needing attention via `attention-next` binding
- Cross-session badge for tracking status across multiple Zellij sessions on the same machine
- Push-driven updates via `zellij pipe` (no polling, minimal performance overhead)
- Support for Claude Code, Codex, Opencode, and custom producers via JSON payloads

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides critical visibility into AI-agent states within existing Zellij workflows, reducing context switching and improving productivity for developers managing multiple AI-driven tasks.
