## Summary
Luma MCP is a multi-model vision understanding MCP server that provides unified image analysis capabilities to AI assistants lacking native vision support. It supports multiple vision models (e.g., GLM-4.6V, DeepSeek-OCR) and offers standardized preprocessing, multi-crop handling, and MCP protocol integration for seamless deployment.

## Key Features
- Unified image analysis via `image_understand` tool supporting multiple vision models (GLM-4.6V, DeepSeek-OCR, Qwen3-VL-Flash, etc.)
- Automatic multi-crop and high-fidelity processing for complex screenshots, code snippets, and dense text scenarios
- Standardized preprocessing pipeline for local files, remote URLs, and Data URIs with SSRF protection
- HTTP/Docker deployment for multi-client sharing (v1.7.0+) with Bearer token authentication
- Built-in retries, compression, and meta-inclusion for debugging and performance tracking

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI assistants without native vision capabilities to perform unified image analysis and OCR, bridging a critical gap for RAG pipelines requiring visual context.
