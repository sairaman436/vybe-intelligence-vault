## Summary
ShellGuard is an MCP server that provides controlled, read-only shell access to remote servers over SSH for LLM agents. It enforces strict command validation and security policies to prevent destructive operations while enabling diagnostic and troubleshooting workflows.

## Key Features
- Enforces read-only command execution with command-level validation and allow/deny lists
- Supports two SSH modes (native and system) with configurable host key verification
- Provides 6 MCP tools for connecting, executing commands, provisioning tools, and downloading files
- Includes automatic toolkit provisioning for remote servers (ripgrep, jq, yq)
- Integrates with popular MCP clients like Cursor, Claude, VS Code, and Zed

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
ShellGuard enables safe, hands-free LLM agent access to production servers for diagnostics and troubleshooting while preventing destructive operations through strict command validation and security policies.
