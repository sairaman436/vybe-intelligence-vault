## Summary
A governed Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes sell-side ad inventory (e.g., Google Ad Manager) to buyer-side AI agents with strict security, privacy, and audit controls. It provides discovery, firm pricing, and a buyer-scoped soft commitment primitive while preventing data over-exposure, accidental writes, and unauthorized access.

## Key Features
- Governed MCP server exposing sell-side ad inventory with default-deny security model
- Discovery of product families and firm pricing without exposing sensitive data (e.g., deal IDs, floor prices)
- Buyer-scoped soft commitment primitive (create/revoke intents) with TTL expiry for controlled transactions
- Hash-chained audit ledger with pseudonymized buyer identities for GDPR compliance and accountability
- Synthetic catalog and forecast data with a planned GAM adapter for real-time inventory integration

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
This project provides a critical governed interface for AI agents to safely interact with sell-side ad inventory, ensuring data privacy, auditability, and controlled transactional capabilities without exposing sensitive systems or enabling unauthorized writes.
