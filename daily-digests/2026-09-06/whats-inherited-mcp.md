## Summary
An MCP server that enumerates and analyzes instruction files, hook commands, declared MCP servers, and agent extensions within a code repository checkout, specifically targeting content addressed to AI agents rather than human reviewers.

## Key Features
- Enumerates instruction files (e.g., CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md) and their token costs, including nested imports
- Identifies hook commands wired to agent events (e.g., session start, tool use)
- Detects declared MCP servers and flags those fetching code at runtime
- Analyzes agent extensions (skills, commands, subagents) shipped in the repository
- Provides conservative, metadata-only reporting to avoid becoming an injection vector

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It exposes hidden instruction surfaces in repositories that AI agents may execute, enabling safer and more transparent code review for AI-driven development workflows.
