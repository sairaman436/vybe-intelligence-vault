## Summary
docker-pibox is a Dockerized container that integrates the pi-coding-agent within an aicodebox environment, providing multiple interaction modes including an API server, Telegram bot, cron scheduler, and MCP server. It acts as a middleware to connect LLMs to various input/output channels and tools.

## Key Features
- Supports five interaction modes: interactive shell, one-shot API, OpenAI-compatible endpoint, MCP server, and Telegram bot
- Includes a cron scheduler for automated task execution with per-job configuration
- Provides an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint for seamless integration with existing tools
- Exposes MCP (Model Context Protocol) for standardized tool integration with AI clients
- Supports multiple LLM providers via Anthropic-compatible endpoints with configurable models and tokens

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It simplifies the deployment and management of AI agents by providing a unified, containerized interface for multiple interaction modes and tool integrations, reducing setup complexity for RAG builders.
