## Summary
Bridge MCP is a Rust-based Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed for secure remote infrastructure management. It provides 476 tools across 9 protocols to manage Linux, Windows, Docker, Kubernetes, databases, and more, with built-in security, audit logging, and MCP 2026-07-28 compliance.

## Key Features
- 476 tools across 9 protocols (SSH, WinRM, Kubernetes, Docker, etc.) for comprehensive infrastructure management
- Security-first design with command whitelisting, secret redaction, tamper-proof audit logging, and MCP confirmation for destructive operations
- MCP 2026-07-28 compliant with progressive tool discovery, task extensions, and client capability negotiation
- Token-efficient output handling via server-side filtering (jq/yq), TSV mode, and pagination
- Daemon mode with Unix socket transport and protocol pooling (WinRM/K8s) for multi-client efficiency

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Bridge MCP is essential for RAG builders as it provides a secure, protocol-agnostic interface to manage diverse infrastructure systems, enabling AI agents to safely execute and audit remote operations with minimal token overhead.
