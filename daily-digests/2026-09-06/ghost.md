## Summary
Ghost is an MCP memory server designed for AI agents like Claude Code and Cursor, providing local, SQLite-based memory storage with hybrid full-text and vector search. It enables cross-client memory persistence without external services, replacing siloed agent memory with a unified, user-owned system.

## Key Features
- Single binary deployment with no external dependencies (optional Ollama for embeddings)
- Hybrid full-text and vector search with Reciprocal Rank Fusion for memory retrieval
- Time-decay scoring and memory consolidation with offline fallback (Jaccard-based)
- Cross-client compatibility via MCP standard over stdio
- Obsidian vault mirror for visualizing and managing memories as a knowledge graph

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Ghost eliminates siloed agent memory by providing a unified, local, and portable memory system that works across any MCP-compatible client, reducing context loss and improving agent consistency.
