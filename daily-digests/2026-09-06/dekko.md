## Summary
dekko is a static code map generator and codebase indexer designed for LLM coding agents. It parses repositories using tree-sitter to create human-readable and machine-readable maps (MAP.md and map.json) that include call graphs, file outlines, and dependency rankings, enabling agents to answer targeted questions about codebases efficiently.

## Key Features
- Generates structured code maps (MAP.md and map.json) with call graphs and file outlines
- Supports 9+ Tier-1 languages (Python, Rust, Java, etc.) and 55+ additional languages via tree-sitter grammars
- Integrates with MCP for direct agent tooling (13 tools including symbol queries, context packs, and worksets)
- Claude Code and Cline plugin support for seamless agent workflows
- Demonstrated 3x–200x token savings over traditional Read/Grep workflows for codebase queries

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
dekko drastically reduces token usage for LLM agents by providing structured, queryable codebase maps, enabling efficient navigation and context gathering without parsing entire files.
