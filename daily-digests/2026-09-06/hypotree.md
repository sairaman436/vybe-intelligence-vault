## Summary
Hypotree is a persistent, self-revising hypothesis DAG for agentic R&D exposed as an MCP server. It enables belief revision and automatic pruning of invalidated hypotheses, reducing redundant computations and token usage in RAG systems.

## Key Features
- Write-back belief revision that propagates evidence failures upstream through dependency edges
- Cascading prune of invalidated hypotheses and their dependent subtrees
- Exclusion-group inference and deduction by elimination for efficient hypothesis resolution
- Thompson Sampling navigation for bounded worst-case regret in hypothesis selection
- Persistent SQLite-based storage with bi-temporal history and live read-only dashboard

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Hypotree eliminates redundant computations and token usage in RAG systems by automatically pruning invalidated hypotheses and deducing truths without extra probes, significantly improving efficiency and reducing costs.
