## Summary
arcane-rmcp is an MCP server and CLI for managing Docker containers, images, networks, volumes, and Compose projects via stdio or HTTP. It bridges Arcane environments with MCP clients, enabling secure, authenticated operations like status checks, resource management, and system operations.

## Key Features
- Exposes a single MCP tool (`arcane`) for managing Docker and Arcane resources with action/subaction dispatch
- Supports both stdio and streamable HTTP MCP interfaces for flexible client integration
- Enforces destructive-operation confirmation and action scopes for safety
- Provides CLI parity with MCP tooling for scripting and debugging
- Offers authentication via static bearer tokens, OAuth, or no-auth loopback mode

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to securely manage Docker and Arcane environments through standardized MCP interfaces, bridging the gap between AI orchestration and containerized infrastructure.
