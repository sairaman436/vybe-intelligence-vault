## Summary
Kinocut is a guardrailed Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and Python library that provides AI agents with structured, safe tools for video editing, media analysis, and repurposing workflows. It abstracts FFmpeg complexity behind typed operations, preflight validation, and provenance receipts to prevent silent failures and enable repeatable, reviewable media automation.

## Key Features
- 135+ structured MCP tools for video editing (trim, resize, merge, add_text, etc.) with guardrails to prevent risky operations
- Workflow engine for agent-driven multi-step video jobs with validate-plan-render-inspect cycles and deterministic receipts
- Preflight validation and quality checkpoints (e.g., `release_checkpoint`) to ensure media integrity before export
- Dedicated video rescue pipeline for source-backed diagnosis, repair planning, and verified output generation
- Layered compositing with blend modes, masks, and transforms for advanced overlays and effects

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Kinocut enables AI agents to safely and repeatably automate video editing workflows without exposing them to brittle FFmpeg commands or silent failures, making it essential for RAG/AI stack builders who need reliable media processing.
