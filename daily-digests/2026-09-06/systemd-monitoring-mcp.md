## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for monitoring Linux systemd services, timers, and logs via JSON-RPC. It provides secure, bearer-token-protected endpoints for querying system state and integrates with AI workflows through standardized MCP tooling.

## Key Features
- Secure MCP server for systemd monitoring with bearer-token authentication
- Tools for listing services, timers, and logs with flexible filtering (e.g., state, scope, priority)
- REST health and discovery endpoints for integration and monitoring
- Supports modern MCP protocol versions (e.g., 2025-03-26) with graceful negotiation
- Read-only operations that do not mutate system state

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI systems to securely monitor and query Linux systemd state in real-time, which is critical for debugging, observability, and automated workflows in production environments.
