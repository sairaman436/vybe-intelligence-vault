## Summary
A cross-platform MCP server written in Rust that enables media downloads from yt-dlp-supported sites (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo) with automated metadata tagging, transfer to local/SSH/rclone destinations, and optional Plex playlist integration. The binary is self-contained, auto-downloading yt-dlp and ffmpeg on first run.

## Key Features
- Self-contained binary with auto-downloaded yt-dlp and ffmpeg dependencies
- Cross-platform media downloads (audio/video) with metadata embedding and cover art
- Robust transfer to local, SSH, or rclone destinations with retry support
- Plex playlist synchronization for downloaded audio tracks
- Repeat-safe downloads with archive-based ID tracking and JSONL ledger

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a secure, self-contained MCP server for media ingestion and organization, critical for AI stacks needing reliable, metadata-rich media processing and transfer capabilities.
