## Summary
ZeroAPI is an OpenClaw plugin that acts as a routing policy layer for AI model subscriptions, intercepting messages at the gateway level to select the optimal model based on benchmark data, provider tiers, and task requirements. It enables data-driven, subscription-aware routing without runtime costs or external API calls.

## Key Features
- Benchmark-aware routing using Artificial Analysis data to select models close to category leaders
- Subscription and account-pool filtering based on user-defined tiers and priorities
- Lightweight two-stage decision process (capability filter + subscription pressure ordering)
- Built-in eval script for analyzing routing logs and suggesting config improvements
- Cross-provider fallback with vision-capable model routing

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
ZeroAPI enables RAG/AI stack builders to optimize model selection dynamically based on real benchmark data and subscription constraints, reducing costs and improving performance without runtime overhead.
