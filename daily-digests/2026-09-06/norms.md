## Summary
Norms is a tool for defining and managing reusable coding rules as Markdown files in a Git repository, ensuring consistency across AI coding agents. It synchronizes these rules into agent-specific formats like AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, and GitHub Copilot instructions.

## Key Features
- Centralized norm management via `.norms/` directory with Markdown files
- Automated synchronization of norms into agent-specific formats (e.g., `.cursor/rules/`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
- CLI commands for initialization, proposal, syncing, and validation (e.g., `norms init`, `norms sync`, `norms lint`)
- Supports scoping norms to specific paths or files using glob patterns
- VS Code extension for seamless integration with development workflows

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Norms ensures AI coding agents adhere to consistent, version-controlled rules, reducing errors and improving collaboration in AI-driven development workflows.
