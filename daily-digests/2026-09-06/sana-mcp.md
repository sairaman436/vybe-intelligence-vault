## Summary
sana-mcp is an MCP server that provides AI agents with local access to Sana.AI meeting transcripts by syncing them into a local SQLite database. It enables search, reading, summarization, and correction of transcripts while maintaining privacy and offline functionality.

## Key Features
- Local SQLite database for instant transcript access without network calls
- Background daemon for automatic syncing of new meetings
- Built-in search with BM25 ranking, phrase/date filters, and sorting
- Transcript correction system that preserves originals and survives re-syncs
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows) with one static binary

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to securely and efficiently access, search, and correct meeting transcripts locally, enhancing RAG pipelines with private, offline-capable transcript data.
