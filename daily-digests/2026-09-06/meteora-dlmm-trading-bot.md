## Summary
A Go-based daemon that continuously monitors Meteora DLMM pools on Solana, screens them through layered risk gates, and batches vetted trading signals for AI agents like Hermes to evaluate and deploy. It automates LP position management with stop-loss, trailing take-profit, and exit strategies.

## Key Features
- Continuous pool discovery via Meteora’s public API with no API keys required
- Batch signaling with HMAC-signed webhooks for AI agent evaluation
- Three screening modes (casual, multiday, turnover) with independent risk thresholds
- Layered risk gates including TVL, fee/TVL, market cap, organic score, and Jupiter audit checks
- Automated exit management with stop-loss, trailing take-profit, and position cooldowns

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a critical signal preprocessing and orchestration layer for AI trading agents, enabling them to make informed decisions on high-quality Solana DLMM pools without manual screening or risk of stale data.
