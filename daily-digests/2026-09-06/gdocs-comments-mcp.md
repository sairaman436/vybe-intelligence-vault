## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI agents to add inline, range-anchored comments to Google Docs, a capability missing from official Google APIs. It drives a real Google Docs session to post comments anchored to specific text fragments.

## Key Features
- Adds anchored comments to Google Docs via UI automation (no official API support)
- Supports both anchored (text-range-specific) and unanchored (whole-document) comments
- Integrates seamlessly with MCP clients (Claude, Cursor, VS Code, etc.)
- One-time login setup with persistent session management
- Designed for AI agents to provide contextual feedback directly in documents

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to deliver precise, human-like feedback directly within Google Docs by anchoring comments to specific text, a critical gap in Google's official APIs.
