## Summary
obs-mcp is an MCP server that enables LLMs to query Prometheus, Thanos, Alertmanager, and optionally Loki, Grafana Tempo, and OpenTelemetry Collector in Kubernetes environments. It bridges observability tools with AI agents via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Key Features
- Enables LLMs to query Prometheus/Thanos metrics and Alertmanager via MCP
- Supports optional integration with Loki (logs), Tempo (traces), and OpenTelemetry Collector
- Multiple authentication modes (kubeconfig, header, serviceaccount) for Kubernetes clusters
- Toolset-based configuration for granular control over available observability tools
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure with Kind cluster setup and E2E validation

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a standardized way for AI agents to interact with critical observability data in Kubernetes, enabling real-time insights and automated decision-making.
