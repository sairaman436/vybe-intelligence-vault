## Summary
A security-focused Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for self-hosted n8n Community Edition, enabling secure management of workflows, executions, credentials, and metadata through 44 bounded tools with progressive safety modes.

## Key Features
- 44 bounded tools for n8n management (workflows, executions, credentials, tags, users, diagnostics)
- Progressive safety modes (read-only, write, unsafe) with per-call confirmation gates for destructive operations
- Deterministic local introspection engine (23-rule) for diagnostics without executing workflows or contacting external models
- Surgical node updates with non-atomic concurrency guards and data minimization (no credential/raw execution values returned)
- Byte-reproducible artifacts, provenance attestations, and reproducible dependency-license gates

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a secure, self-hosted interface to manage n8n workflows and metadata for AI agents while enforcing strict safety and data minimization policies.
