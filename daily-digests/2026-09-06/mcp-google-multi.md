## Summary
A local MCP server that enables Claude Code and other MCP clients to interact with multiple Google Workspace accounts (Gmail, Drive, Calendar, Sheets, Docs, etc.) via OAuth2 authentication, providing ~175 tools for cross-account operations with strict security controls.

## Key Features
- Multi-account support with alias-based switching across Google Workspace services
- Secure token encryption at rest (AES-256-GCM) with deny-by-default write policies
- ~175 tools spanning Gmail, Drive, Calendar, Sheets, Docs, Contacts, and more
- Discover-first tooling model to minimize context overload in AI clients
- Fine-grained write control via profiles (read-only, safe-writes, full-writes) and glob-based policies

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides secure, multi-account access to Google Workspace tools for AI agents, enabling seamless integration with enterprise workflows while maintaining strict security and control.
