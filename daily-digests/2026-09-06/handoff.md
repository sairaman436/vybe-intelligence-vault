## Summary
handoff is a CLI tool enabling coordinator-executor collaboration between AI agents (e.g., Claude Code, opencode, grok, codex) for task execution and review. It separates execution from review, persists state locally, and supports remote compute via direct WebSocket connections.

## Key Features
- Separates execution from review with a permission gate system
- Persists state locally (SQLite) for resilience across disconnections
- Supports remote compute via direct WebSocket connections
- No central server required; peer-to-peer architecture
- Battle-tested workflow for AI-driven development

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables safe, auditable AI agent collaboration by separating execution from review and persisting state, critical for RAG builders managing multi-agent workflows.
