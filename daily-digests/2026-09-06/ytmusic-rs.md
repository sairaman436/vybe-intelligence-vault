## Summary
A Rust-based Model Context Protocol (MCP) stdio server that provides YouTube Music integration, including search, playlist management, and authentication via Google OAuth. It is a port of a TypeScript MCP server but optimized for Rust with reduced scope and improved security.

## Key Features
- Rust-based MCP stdio server for YouTube Music integration
- Supports search, playlist creation, and management tools
- Secure OAuth 2.0 authentication with required encryption key
- Reduced scope to avoid complexity (e.g., no adaptive recommendations or PostgreSQL persistence)
- Fixed security issues from the TypeScript original (e.g., no hardcoded encryption keys)

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a secure, Rust-native MCP server for YouTube Music integration, enabling AI agents to interact with playlists and search functionality without relying on TypeScript or external databases.
