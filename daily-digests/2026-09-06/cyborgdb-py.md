## Summary
The CyborgDB Python SDK is a client library for CyborgDB, an encrypted vector database that enables similarity search directly on ciphertext without decrypting the index. It integrates seamlessly with AI workflows and supports features like BYOK, encrypted ANN, and per-tenant key isolation.

## Key Features
- Search on encrypted data with client-side keys; only query results are decrypted
- Disk-backed encrypted DiskIVF index with high recall (within 2% of plaintext)
- Supports filters on encrypted metadata for combined vector and predicate queries
- Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) via AWS KMS or Secrets Manager, or use client-side keys
- Per-tenant key isolation with cryptographic RBAC for secure multi-user access

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
CyborgDB enables secure, privacy-preserving vector search for RAG systems by allowing similarity search directly on encrypted data, eliminating the need to decrypt sensitive indexes while maintaining high performance.
