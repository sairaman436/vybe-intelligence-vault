## Summary
An MCP server that enables AI assistants to read, write, and manipulate Altium Designer component libraries (PCB footprints and schematic symbols) by handling the undocumented binary file formats. It bridges AI-driven engineering with Altium's ecosystem, allowing AI to create and maintain any component without manual file editing.

## Key Features
- 34 MCP tools for reading, writing, and editing Altium `.PcbLib` and `.SchLib` files
- Byte-identical file output to Altium's native format, ensuring compatibility
- Supports all footprint primitives (pads, vias, tracks, arcs, regions, text, fills, 3D models) and schematic primitives (pins, shapes, text, parameters)
- Automatic backups and validation to prevent file corruption
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS) for MCP clients like Claude Code, Cursor, and VS Code Copilot

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI assistants to directly generate and maintain Altium component libraries, eliminating manual file editing and accelerating PCB design workflows.
