## Summary
AgentGuard is a security and governance tool designed to discover, inventory, and assess the risk of AI agents and MCP servers across an organization's environment. It integrates with DataHub to publish metadata, enabling compliance with frameworks like the EU AI Act and OWASP LLM Top 10 standards.

## Key Features
- Automated discovery of AI agents and MCP servers across environments (configs, ports, processes, Docker, env files)
- Risk scoring (0-100) based on exposure, tool capabilities, and orphaned endpoints, mapped to OWASP LLM Top 10 and EU AI Act tiers
- Integration with DataHub for metadata cataloging, lineage tracking, and compliance reporting
- Read-only discovery with no credential exposure or agent modification
- CI/CD integration with exit codes for critical asset detection

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
AgentGuard provides critical visibility and risk management for AI agent fleets, ensuring compliance with emerging regulations and mitigating security risks like orphaned endpoints and unauthorized tool access.
