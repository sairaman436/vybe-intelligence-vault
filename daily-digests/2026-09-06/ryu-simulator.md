## Summary
ryu-simulator is a control server that enables programmatic interaction with iOS Simulators and Android Emulators via a local sidecar. It exposes capabilities like device management, app installation, deep link handling, and input simulation through a grant-gated HTTP API.

## Key Features
- Cross-platform device control for iOS and Android via simctl and adb
- Grant-gated HTTP API for secure access to simulator capabilities
- Lazy-spawned sidecar with idle timeout for resource efficiency
- Supports booting, installing, launching apps, and deep link handling
- Modular design allowing replacement of the sidecar without core changes

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides essential device automation capabilities for AI agents to interact with mobile simulators and emulators, enabling testing and interaction workflows in RAG systems.
