## Summary
A streamable-HTTP MCP server that exposes Malaysia's Government Open API as read-only tools via HTTPS, enabling remote access for AI models like ChatGPT. It mirrors the functionality of a bundled plugin server for OpenAI plugin submissions.

## Key Features
- Exposes 6 read-only government API tools (weather, data catalog, GTFS, etc.) via HTTPS
- Supports MCP streamable-HTTP JSON-RPC for tool discovery and invocation
- Includes OpenAI domain verification endpoint for plugin submissions
- Implements rate limiting to comply with government API constraints
- Lightweight parsing of GTFS static ZIPs and GTFS-RT protobuf in-Worker

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI models to securely access Malaysia's government data APIs via a standardized MCP interface, simplifying integration for RAG builders.
