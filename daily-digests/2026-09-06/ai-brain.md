## Summary
A project-local AI knowledge brain that continuously indexes code and learns from project artifacts to provide a unified, traceable source of truth for AI coding agents. It enforces consistency across tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and Copilot by binding them to a shared project-specific contract.

## Key Features
- Continuous, token-free code indexing via AST and regex with debounced updates
- Project-local knowledge base committed to git, ensuring portability and versioning
- MCP server with 12 tools for AI agent integration (e.g., brain_entity, brain_code_search)
- Sub-agent system for specialized tasks like requirement refinement and style learning
- Enforcement of the 'Iron Law' contract across AI tools to ensure traceability and consistency

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It eliminates the need to re-explain projects to AI agents by providing a persistent, project-specific knowledge base that binds every coding tool to a shared source of truth, drastically improving consistency and reducing API costs.
