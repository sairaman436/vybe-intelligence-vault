## Summary
sop-mcp is an MCP server that enforces step-by-step execution of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for AI agents, ensuring predictable and auditable behavior by forcing agents to complete each step before advancing. It aligns with the Agent SOPs standard for defining workflows using RFC 2119 requirements.

## Key Features
- Enforces step-by-step execution of SOPs to prevent LLM skipping or summarizing steps
- Integrates with Agent SOPs standard for defining workflows with RFC 2119 requirements
- Provides bundled SOPs for immediate testing (e.g., code review, employee onboarding)
- Supports dynamic discovery and execution of SOPs via MCP tools like `list_resources` and `run_sop`
- Includes tools for publishing, feedback submission, and resource management

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It ensures AI agents follow structured, auditable processes by enforcing step-by-step execution, reducing unpredictability in multi-step workflows.
