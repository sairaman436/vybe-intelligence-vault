## Summary
A modular Hybrid RAG system built on Clean Architecture principles, enabling provider-independent document retrieval with semantic and keyword-based hybrid search. It decouples core logic from infrastructure dependencies like databases and LLMs for maximum flexibility.

## Key Features
- Provider-agnostic architecture allowing seamless switching between databases (MongoDB, Supabase, PostgreSQL) and AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Local)
- Hybrid retrieval combining semantic and keyword search with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) for improved accuracy
- Strict separation of concerns via Clean Architecture with Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Endpoints layers
- CLI-first interface designed for technical workflows and easy integration into pipelines
- Built-in modular ingestion pipeline supporting parsing, chunking, and embedding with extensible provider support

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
This repository provides a production-grade blueprint for building scalable, maintainable Hybrid RAG systems with clean architectural separation, making it essential for developers aiming to integrate or extend RAG capabilities in enterprise environments.
