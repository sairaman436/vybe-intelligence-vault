## Summary
Abluva-maintained fork of `mcp-remote` that acts as a stdio proxy to connect MCP clients (e.g., Claude Desktop, Cursor) to remote MCP servers with OAuth authentication, addressing critical upstream bugs and improving reliability for production use.

## Key Features
- Resolves upstream OAuth bugs (mid-session re-auth, token expiry, localhost callback issues)
- Supports multiple transport strategies (SSE-first, HTTP-first, etc.)
- Auto-selects callback ports to avoid conflicts
- Debug and silent logging modes for troubleshooting
- Static OAuth client metadata configuration for custom servers

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables seamless OAuth authentication for stdio-only MCP clients to connect reliably to remote MCP servers, resolving critical upstream issues that hinder production deployments.
