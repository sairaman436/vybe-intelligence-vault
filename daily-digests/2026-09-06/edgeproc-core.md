## Summary
A lightweight Python library that provides a protocol and reference implementation for partitioning vector embeddings across multiple tenants, users, or time periods in multi-tenant vector search systems. It routes vectors to the correct partitions and merges search results while ensuring isolation and performance.

## Key Features
- Protocol-based partitioning strategies (Global, Bucketed, Hot-and-cold) with one-line swapping
- Conformance suite to validate backend implementations for cross-tenant safety
- Supports major vector index backends (FAISS, pgvector, hnswlib) without shipping them
- Benchmarking tools for routing and search latency (e.g., p50 5.8ms routing, p95 19.2ms search)
- Strict type checking (mypy --strict) and ≥90% branch coverage with automated CI/CD

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a critical foundation for multi-tenant RAG systems by ensuring secure, performant, and scalable vector partitioning without reinventing the wheel for every deployment.
