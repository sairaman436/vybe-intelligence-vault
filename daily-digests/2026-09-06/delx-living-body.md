## Summary
A Meta-MCP server that unifies 15 wellness data connectors into a single body data layer for AI agents, enabling natural-language queries like 'Should I train hard today?' with rule-based synthesis and no LLM calls.

## Key Features
- Auto-detects and composes 15+ wellness connectors (WHOOP, Oura, Garmin, etc.) without manual configuration
- Synthesizes unified answers using rule-based reasoning (no LLM calls) with structured reasoning traces
- Local-first and privacy-preserving—never reads child connector tokens or credentials
- Supports parallel child MCP server spawning with configurable timeouts and caching
- Provides 6 tools for status checks, daily briefs, context composition, and health diagnostics

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It simplifies RAG/AI agent workflows by unifying fragmented wellness data into a single, queryable layer with deterministic reasoning, reducing integration complexity and improving agent decision-making.
