## Summary
A Telegram bot daemon that enables remote control of the local opencode agent from a mobile device via a Windows PC. It allows sending prompts, managing models/agents/projects, and approving tool permissions without exposing open ports, using Telegram long polling for communication.

## Key Features
- Telegram-based remote control of local opencode agent with zero open ports
- Real-time streaming of responses with in-place message editing to avoid spam
- Hard allowlist for Telegram user IDs to restrict access
- Project switching and session management with persistent state
- Permission approval workflows via inline keyboards

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables seamless remote interaction with local AI agents, bridging mobile convenience with local compute power for RAG and agent workflows.
