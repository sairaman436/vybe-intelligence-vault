## Summary
A high-performance, code-aware file search CLI and MCP server that replaces traditional tools like `find`, `grep`, and `cat` with a single binary. It combines fuzzy file search, tree-sitter-powered symbol navigation, and token-budget-aware file reading for both humans and AI agents.

## Key Features
- Replaces multiple CLI tools (`find`, `grep`, `cat`) with a single binary for efficiency
- Tree-sitter-powered symbol indexing and navigation (definitions, callers, callees, refs, flow, impact)
- Frecency-ranked and typo-resistant fuzzy search for both files and content
- Token-budget-aware file reader for AI agents to avoid overwhelming context
- MCP server integration for seamless use with AI assistants like Claude Code or Cursor

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It streamlines file and symbol search for AI agents while reducing latency and context overhead, making it essential for building efficient RAG pipelines.
