## Summary
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with Jellyseerr/Overseerr to enable AI agents to search for media, check availability, and create guarded media requests. It acts as a safe, read-only and guarded-write interface for managing media requests without direct access to Radarr/Sonarr.

## Key Features
- Six tools for media discovery, confirmation, request creation, and status tracking with Jellyseerr/Overseerr
- Guarded write operations with preview mode and explicit confirmation for safety
- PII and infrastructure redaction to protect sensitive data
- Status decoding for human-readable error handling and guidance
- Supports both STDIO and Streamable HTTP transports for MCP clients

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a secure, agent-friendly interface to manage media requests via Jellyseerr/Overseerr, enabling AI systems to safely interact with media libraries without exposing sensitive backend details.
