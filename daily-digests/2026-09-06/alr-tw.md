## Summary
ALR-TW is a secure harness for agentic RAG and MCP-based legal research in Taiwan, designed to validate legal claims, evidence, and citations while enforcing server-side trust boundaries. It integrates with official legal sources and optional TLR for candidate recall, ensuring deterministic validation without exposing raw data or LLM logic.

## Key Features
- Server-owned research obligations with strict trust boundaries to prevent external manipulation of sources or citations
- Integration with official Taiwanese legal sources (laws, judgments, constitutional rulings) and optional TLR for candidate recall in hybrid mode
- Deterministic trust gates for claim support, evidence sufficiency, time context, and privacy screening
- MCP tools for legal research workflows (e.g., `research_legal_question`, `validate_legal_answer`, `purge_research_storage`)
- Fail-closed validation with three-tiered outcomes: `validated`, `qualified`, or `blocked`

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
ALR-TW provides a critical safety layer for RAG builders working with legal data by enforcing server-side validation and citation integrity, ensuring compliance with Taiwan's legal framework.
