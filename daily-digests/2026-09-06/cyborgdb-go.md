## Summary
The CyborgDB Go SDK is a Go client for CyborgDB, an encrypted vector database that enables similarity search directly on encrypted data. The SDK communicates with a self-hosted service, allowing secure vector operations with client-side key management and cryptographic RBAC.

## Key Features
- Search on encrypted data with client-side keys; only query results are decrypted
- Disk-backed encrypted DiskIVF index with near-plaintext recall performance
- Supports complex metadata filtering (equality, range, logical operators) on encrypted data
- Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) or Hold Your Own Key (HYOK) with AWS KMS or Secrets Manager integration
- Per-tenant key isolation with cryptographic RBAC for secure multi-tenancy

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables secure, privacy-preserving vector search for RAG systems by allowing encrypted data operations without exposing raw vectors or indexes to the database server.
