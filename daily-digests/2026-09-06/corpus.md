## Summary
corpus-rag is a local-first, personal knowledge system that enables users to store, index, and query their documents (notes, PDFs, HTML, etc.) entirely on their own machine using plain English queries. It combines SQLite for storage with local or API-based embeddings (Voyage or Gemini) and supports hybrid search with BM25 and vector retrieval.

## Key Features
- Hybrid search combining semantic vectors and BM25 with auto-fused weights
- Local SQLite storage for vectors, BM25 FTS, and metadata (no external vector DB required)
- Idempotent and incremental ingestion with deduplication and pruning of orphaned chunks
- Seven MCP tools for integration with Claude Code/Desktop (e.g., search, expand_context, summaries)
- Built-in connectors for markdown, text, PDF, and HTML with optional extras for additional formats

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a self-contained, privacy-preserving RAG system that eliminates the need for external vector databases or cloud services, making it ideal for personal archives and sensitive data.
