## Summary
Kernava MCP is a Rust-based MCP server that builds and serves an in-memory call graph for codebases, enabling efficient structural queries like call relationships, dead code detection, and impact analysis without re-reading source files.

## Key Features
- In-RAM call graph with lock-free reads for sub-millisecond query responses
- Supports 11 languages with incremental re-indexing and content-hash dedup
- SQLite-WAL persistence with FTS5 full-text search for symbols and code
- 16 MCP tools for structural queries (callers, callees, impact radius, dead code, etc.)
- Streamable HTTP transport via rmcp for long-lived, warm sessions

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Kernava MCP enables AI agents to efficiently query code structure without token-heavy file reads, making it essential for RAG systems that need to analyze or reason about codebases.
