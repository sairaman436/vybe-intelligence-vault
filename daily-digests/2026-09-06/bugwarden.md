## Summary
bugwarden is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server written in Rust that acts as a secure intermediary between LLMs and a Bugzilla instance, enforcing operator-defined security policies to control AI agent access to bug data and actions.

## Key Features
- Operator-controlled security policy engine with fine-grained access control for Bugzilla data and actions
- No existence oracle: policy-denied bugs are indistinguishable from nonexistent ones
- Supports both HTTP and stdio MCP transports with configurable API key handling
- Silent search filtering and redacted summaries for restricted bugs
- Single static binary with async architecture for high performance

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides essential security guardrails for AI agents interacting with Bugzilla, ensuring sensitive data is never exposed while enabling controlled access to bug information for RAG applications.
