## Summary
Symphony is a self-hosted AI-agent dispatcher that converts issues from a tracker (Podium) into completed work via pluggable coding agents (Pi or Claude) in isolated git worktrees. It automates infrastructure remediation and task execution with human review gates and structured verdicts.

## Key Features
- Tracker-driven dispatch with Podium integration for issue polling and workflow templating
- Pluggable agent support (Pi or Claude) with common adapter seam for multi-agent execution
- Isolated git worktrees for safe, concurrent task execution with auto-merge and reconciliation
- Structured verdict system (done/review/blocked) for deterministic follow-up actions
- Durable state management with SQLite, Alembic migrations, and recovery mechanisms for orphaned runs

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
Symphony provides a critical orchestration layer for RAG builders by automating agent-driven task completion with human oversight and structured outputs.
