## Summary
wpguard-mcp is a guarded WordPress MCP server that enables AI clients to interact with WordPress sites through named, typed verbs instead of raw PHP execution. It enforces a closed-by-default architecture with dry-run previews, pre-write backups, and human-in-the-loop approval for all modifications, while demoting raw PHP execution to a deliberately gated escape hatch.

## Key Features
- Named, typed verbs for WordPress operations (no raw PHP by default)
- Tiered access model: recon (read-only), guarded mutations, and gated raw eval
- Dry-run previews enabled by default with `apply=False`
- Pre-write backups and rollback capabilities for all modifications
- Human-in-the-loop approval required for all writes via change packets

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a safer, structured approach to WordPress AI automation by enforcing named verbs as the primary interface and gating raw execution, reducing the risk of catastrophic AI-driven changes.
