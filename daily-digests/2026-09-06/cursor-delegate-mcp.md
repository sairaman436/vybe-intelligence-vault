## Summary
Cursor Delegate MCP is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) bridge that enables AI coding agents like Claude Code or ChatGPT to delegate implementation tasks to Cursor's CLI agent (Composer 2.5). It streamlines multi-file edits by offloading execution to Cursor while keeping planning and review with the primary agent, improving speed and reducing API usage costs.

## Key Features
- Delegates implementation tasks to Cursor's CLI agent while retaining planning and review with primary AI agents
- Supports structured, typed output for clean results including changed files, plan, and session ID
- Works across multiple MCP clients (Claude Code, ChatGPT, Copilot CLI, VS Code, JetBrains, etc.)
- Includes self-diagnosing tools like `doctor` for setup validation and `cancel` for mid-run termination
- Optimizes API usage by billing delegated work to Cursor's separate usage pool

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables AI agents to offload heavy implementation tasks to Cursor's CLI agent, reducing API costs and improving task completion speed for RAG builders.
