## Summary
An experimental orchestration framework that enables LLM agents to process datasets larger than the model's context window through iterative retrieval, semantic reduction, and adaptive chunking. It separates orchestration and reduction roles to handle large-scale external data efficiently.

## Key Features
- Iterative data loading and processing to handle datasets larger than context limits
- Semantic reduction pipeline to compress and filter tool outputs before reinjection
- Adapter-based integration with OpenAPI and MCP for tool discovery and execution
- Adaptive processing strategies (Direct Pass, Single Reduction, Paginated Reduction)
- Separation of short-term and long-term memory to control context growth

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables RAG systems to process and reason over large-scale external datasets that exceed model context windows, improving scalability and reducing token costs.
