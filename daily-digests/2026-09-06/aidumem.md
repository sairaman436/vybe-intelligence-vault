## Summary
aiduMEM is an AI 'thought engine' designed to provide persistent memory, reasoning, and cognitive architecture for AI agents. It goes beyond simple key-value storage by integrating memory optimization, forgetting curves, multi-agent federation, and hybrid retrieval mechanisms to enable AI systems to remember, reason, and evolve over time.

## Key Features
- Ebbinghaus forgetting curve-based memory decay with configurable decay rates for different memory types (emotional, factual, procedural).
- Relevance gate mechanism to filter out irrelevant context, reducing token usage by up to 100x and improving response times from 10ms to 1ms.
- Tidal coalescing for asynchronous batch processing of short messages, optimizing LLM calls by merging multiple messages into single API requests.
- Chronos dual timeline for time-aware memory validity with valid_from/valid_to fields, ensuring expired facts are deprioritized without deletion.
- Pantheon federation for multi-agent memory sharing with MoE (Mixture-of-Experts) gate control, enabling seamless collaboration and shared knowledge bases.

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
aiduMEM provides a sophisticated cognitive framework that enables AI agents to retain context, reason over time, and evolve their knowledge, making it essential for building advanced RAG systems with long-term memory and reasoning capabilities.
