## Summary
edinet-mcp is a Python library and MCP server that provides programmatic access to Japan's EDINET financial disclosure system, parsing XBRL filings into normalized financial statements and qualitative narratives for Japanese companies. It exposes these capabilities as an MCP server for AI assistants and local data processing tools.

## Key Features
- Normalizes XBRL filings across accounting standards (J-GAAP, IFRS, US-GAAP) into canonical Japanese labels with bilingual support
- Exposes financial data via an MCP server for integration with AI assistants like Claude Desktop
- Supports multi-company screening, cross-period comparisons, and narrative section extraction (e.g., business risks, MD&A)
- Provides financial metrics (ROE, ROA, profit margins) and year-over-year comparisons with DataFrame export capabilities
- Fully local and free, requiring only a free EDINET API key with no usage caps beyond EDINET's rate limits

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It enables RAG/AI stack builders to programmatically access and normalize high-quality Japanese financial data for AI assistants and analytics without relying on paid APIs or external services.
