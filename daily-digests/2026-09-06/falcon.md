## Summary
falcon provides shared MCP server scaffolding for the Hawk ecosystem, wrapping mark3labs/mcp-go to offer standardized construction, transports, and handler helpers for tools, prompts, and resources. It simplifies MCP server development for AI agents and tools in the Hawk ecosystem.

## Key Features
- Wraps mark3labs/mcp-go to provide standardized MCP server scaffolding
- Supports tools, prompts, resources, and graph resources with handlers
- Offers both stdio and HTTP transports with configurable security (bearer tokens)
- Enforces ecosystem boundaries to prevent circular dependencies
- Provides helper functions for argument extraction and JSON results

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
falcon simplifies the development of MCP servers for AI agents and tools, reducing duplication and ensuring consistency across the Hawk ecosystem.
