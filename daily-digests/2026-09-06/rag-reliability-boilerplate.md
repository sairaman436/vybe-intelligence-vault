## Summary
A TypeScript-based boilerplate for detecting and rejecting ungrounded RAG outputs before delivery, ensuring deterministic validation of hallucinations, vacuous extractions, and stale context propagation. It provides a structured pipeline with Sentinel, Synthesis, and Orchestrator stages, supporting multiple transport layers (HTTP, MCP, LangChain, CI).

## Key Features
- Deterministic critic-based validation of RAG outputs with coverage ratio checks
- Multi-stage pipeline (Sentinel, Synthesis, Orchestrator) for ingestion, extraction, and delivery
- Support for multiple transport layers (HTTP, MCP, LangChain, CI/CD)
- Explicit handling of rejected outputs via `critic_rejected` status (not exceptions)
- HMAC-signed webhook delivery with retry logic for reliability

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a critical safety layer for RAG systems by ensuring outputs are grounded in retrieved context before delivery, reducing hallucinations and ungrounded claims in production applications.
