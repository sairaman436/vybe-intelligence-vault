## Summary
MyGameMaster is an LLM-powered tabletop RPG Game Master that runs live sessions on Discord, managing game state, NPCs, factions, and narratives with a living-world engine. It deploys isolated per campaign using Podman containers managed by Ansible, ensuring coherence across sessions.

## Key Features
- Isolated per-campaign deployment with Podman containers managed by Ansible
- Living-world engine with 4D space-time model for coherent world state across sessions
- 16 modular skill modules for session management, game mechanics, NPCs, factions, and narrative generation
- Runtime hooks for state injection, JSON integrity, Steward compliance, and LLM judging
- Feature flags for traceability, verbosity, NPCs, factions, temporality, images, and voice

## Why It Matters for RAG Builders
It provides a production-ready framework for deploying AI-powered game masters with isolated, reproducible environments, making it ideal for testing and iterating on agent-based RAG systems in interactive settings.
